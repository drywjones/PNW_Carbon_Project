Research Paper FPL-RP-662","","","","","http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplrp/fpl_rp662.pdf","The U.S. Forest Products Module (USFPM) is a partial market equilibrium model of the U.S. forest sector that operates within the Global Forest Products Model (GFPM) to provide long-range timber market projections in relation to global economic scenarios. USFPM was designed specifically for the 2010 RPA forest assessment, but it is being used also in other applications. Within the GFPM framework of global forest product markets and trade, USFPM models aggregate U.S. forest product demands and regional forest product production, timber harvest, and timber stumpage markets in three U.S. subregions: North, South, and West. In each subregion, USFPM models timber stumpage markets for four categories of timber, including hardwood and softwood sawtimber and hardwood and softwood non-sawtimber. USFPM models regional timber harvest and transport activities as the conversion of timber stumpage supplies into delivered timber product outputs (sawlogs/veneer logs, pulpwood/composite timber, other industrial roundwood, and fuelwood) plus logging residues. USFPM also adds more complete product detail in U.S. regions, by differentiating hardwood lumber and softwood lumber, OSB structural panels and industrial particleboard, and hardwood and softwood plywood. In addition, USFPM models potential future supplies of agricultural short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) for energy and fiber, along with wood residue byproducts of sawmills and plywood mills, and the utilization of those materials in production of pulp, wood panels, and energy. USFPM thus models all forms of wood biomass feedstock that could be used potentially for future energy production in the United States, including fuelwood harvest, other roundwood, mill residues, agricultural SRWC, and logging residues. This report describes the structure of USFPM in detail and presents some examples of results and conclusions about future trends in wood energy demands and U.S. timber markets based on USFPM and GFPM projections. A key finding is that projected future trends in U.S. consumption, production, and net trade in forest products are heavily influenced by assumptions about future expansion in U.S. and global wood energy demands. The projected effects of expansion in U.S. and global wood energy consumption are to dampen growth in forest product consumption (because of price impacts on demands) but also to provide greater comparative advantages and enhanced net exports for U.S. producers of forest products (because of price impacts on foreign producers). Prodigious expansion in wood energy demands could cause significant escalation in real U.S. timber prices, but on the other hand, real U.S. timber stumpage prices are not projected to increase without fairly substantial increases in wood energy consumption.","2011","2020-06-18 17:39:03","2021-12-07 19:28:35","","61","","","","","","","","","","2010 RPA Assessment","USDA, USFS, Forest Products Laboratory","Madison, WI","","","GTR","","","","","","<p>GFPM_USFPM</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\HP23W9TA\Ince et al. - 2011 - U.S. Forest Products Module A technical document .pdf","","Pools; Wood products; Agriculture; WD; Reports (non-GTR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, scaling up from field-based measurements of forest C stocks and fluxes to understand global scale C cycling and its climate sensitivity remains an important challenge. Tens of thousands of forest C measurements have been made, but these data have yet to be integrated into a single database that makes them accessible for integrated analyses. Here we present an open-access global Forest Carbon database (ForC) containing previously published records of field-based measurements of ecosystem-level C stocks and annual fluxes, along with disturbance history and methodological information. ForC expands upon the previously published tropical portion of this database, TropForC (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t516f), now including 17,367 records (previously 3,568) representing 2,731 plots (previously 845) in 826 geographically distinct areas. The database covers all forested biogeographic and climate zones, represents forest stands of all ages, and currently includes data collected between 1934 and 2015. We expect that ForC will prove useful for macroecological analyses of forest C cycling, for evaluation of model predictions or remote sensing products, for quantifying the contribution of forests to the global C cycle, and for supporting international efforts to inventory forest carbon and greenhouse gas exchange.

STSMs are stochastic, empirical simulation models that use an adapted Markov chain approach to predict how vegetation will transition between states over time, typically in response to interactions between succession, disturbances and management. With STSMs a landscape is divided into a set of simulation cells, each cell is assigned to an initial vegetation state, and the model then predicts how each cell may change from one vegetation state to another over time. Over the years an extensive suite of features have been added to STSMs that allow them to represent a range of dynamics important to landscape modeling, including tracking age-structure, triggering transitions based on past events, setting targets for certain transitions, and varying transition rates over time. STSMs are also now able to represent spatial variability in two different ways: by dividing the landscape into spatial strata, typically defined by one or more important drivers of vegetation change, or alternatively by developing a spatially-explicit STSM, whereby transition events, such as fire or invasion by non-native vegetation, can be simulated to spread across the landscape. Since their introduction in the early 1990s, STSMs have been applied to a wide range of landscapes and management questions, including forests, rangelands, grasslands, wetlands and aquatic communities, over spatial extents ranging from thousands to millions of hectares. Several software tools currently exist to support the development of STSMs; the most recent of these products, called the Path Landscape Model, is the latest in a lineage of STSM development tools that includes both the Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool (VDDT) and the Tool for Exploratory Landscape Analysis (TELSA).

However, there are large uncertainties in how land and climate systems will evolve and interact to shape future ecosystem carbon dynamics. To address this we developed the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (LUCAS) to track changes in land use, land cover, land management, and disturbance, and their impact on ecosystem carbon storage and flux within a scenario-based framework. We have combined a state-and-transition simulation model (STSM) of land change with a stock and flow model of carbon dynamics. Land-change projections downscaled from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) were used to drive changes within the STSM, while the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) ecosystem model was used to derive input parameters for the carbon stock and flow model. The model was applied to the Sierra Nevada Mountains ecoregion in California, USA, a region prone to large wildfires and a forestry sector projected to intensify over the next century. Three scenario simulations were conducted, including a calibration scenario, a climate-change scenario, and an integrated climate- and land-change scenario. Based on results from the calibration scenario, the LUCAS age-structured carbon accounting model was able to accurately reproduce results obtained from the process-based biogeochemical model. Under the climate-only scenario, the ecoregion was projected to be a reliable net sink of carbon, however, when land use and disturbance were introduced, the ecoregion switched to become a net source. This research demonstrates how an integrated approach to carbon accounting can be used to evaluate various drivers of ecosystem carbon change in a robust, yet transparent modeling environment.","2015","2020-05-20 23:09:58","2020-10-09 18:35:36","","577-606","","3","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>STSM</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\P2HGFXH3\Sleeter et al. - 2015 - An integrated approach to modeling changes in land.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Processes; Disturbance; Land use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

State-and-transition simulation models (STSMs) provide a general framework for forecasting landscape dynamics, including projections of both vegetation and landuse/land-cover (LULC) change. The STSM method divides a landscape into spatially referenced cells and then simulates the state of each cell forward in time, as a discrete-time stochastic process using a Monte Carlo approach, in response to any number of possible transitions. A current limitation of the STSM method, however, is that all of the state variables must be discrete. 2. Here we present a new approach for extending a STSM, in order to account for continuous state variables, called a STSM with stocks and flows (STSM-SF). The STSM–SF method allows for any number of continuous stocks to be defined for every spatial cell in the STSM, along with a suite of continuous flows specifying the rates at which stock levels change over time. The change in the level of each stock is then simulated forward in time, for each spatial cell, as a discrete-time stochastic process. The method differs from the traditional systems dynamics approach to stock-flow modelling in that the stocks and flows can be spatially explicit, and the flows can be expressed as a function of the STSM states and transitions. 3. We demonstrate the STSM-SF method by integrating a spatially explicit carbon (C) budget model with a STSM of LULC change for the state of Hawai’i, USA. In this example, continuous stocks are pools of terrestrial C, whereas the flows are the possible fluxes of C between these pools. Importantly, several of these C fluxes are triggered by corresponding LULC transitions in the STSM. Model outputs include changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of C pools and fluxes across the landscape in response to projected future changes in LULC over the next 50 years. 4. The new STSM-SF method allows both discrete and continuous state variables to be integrated into a STSM, including interactions between them. With the addition of stocks and flows, STSMs provide a conceptually simple yet powerful approach for characterizing uncertainties in projections of a wide range of questions regarding landscape change.","2018","2020-05-20 23:04:09","2021-02-25 17:18:25","","1133–1143","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>STSM</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\7BISCCSA\Daniel et al. - 2018 - Integrating continuous stocks and flows into state.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A wide range of spatially explicit simulation models have been developed to forecast landscape dynamics, including models for projecting changes in both vegetation and land use. While these models have generally been developed as separate applications, each with a separate purpose and audience, they share many common features. 2. We present a general framework, called a state-and-transition simulation model (STSM), which captures a number of these common features, accompanied by a software product, called ST-Sim, to build and run such models. The STSM method divides a landscape into a set of discrete spatial units and simulates the discrete state of each cell forward as a discrete-time-inhomogeneous stochastic process. The method differs from a spatially interacting Markov chain in several important ways, including the ability to add discrete counters such as age and time-since-transition as state variables, to specify one-step transition rates as either probabilities or target areas, and to represent multiple types of transitions between pairs of states. 3. We demonstrate the STSM method using a model of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change for the state of Hawai’i, USA. Processes represented in this example include expansion/contraction of agricultural lands, urbanization, wildfire, shrub encroachment into grassland and harvest of tree plantations; the model also projects shifts in moisture zones due to climate change. Key model output includes projections of the future spatial and temporal distribution of LULC classes and moisture zones across the landscape over the next 50 years. 4. State-and-transition simulation models can be applied to a wide range of landscapes, including questions of both land-use change and vegetation dynamics. Because the method is inherently stochastic, it is well suited for characterizing uncertainty in model projections. When combined with the ST-Sim software, STSMs offer a simple yet powerful means for developing a wide range of models of landscape dynamics.","2016","2020-05-20 23:01:19","2020-10-05 19:21:42","","1413–1423","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","; <p>STSM</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\G7UA88GI\Daniel et al. - 2016 - State-and-transition simulation models a framewor.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results predict the yield of poplar cultivation at a spatial resolution of 64 km2 throughout the 8,000,000 km2 of the study region. Existing agricultural cultivation patterns were used to estimate regional water availability for irrigation, and for non-irrigated regions, land cover features including ownership, slope, soil salinity and water table depth where used to select areas with a real potential to support a SRWC plantation. Results can be integrated with other models that allow for optimizing crop selection and biorefinery site selection. Important results include; an updated 3PG model for coppiced SRWC plantings, estimates of biomass feedstock yields under different irrigation patterns and weather conditions, and estimates for feedstock availability when combined with crop adoption scenarios.","2015","2020-05-11 21:57:00","2021-12-07 18:47:34","","12-27","","","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>3-PG</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\JSMIFTFD\Hart et al. - 2015 - Modeling poplar growth as a short rotation woody c.pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; Growth; Fuel wood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advances in modelling system result in the formulation of numerous forest modelling approaches to provide an estimation of forests services. One such useful and straightforward forest modelling approach is process-based modelling, relying on physiological processes and biophysical parameters of forest ecosystems. It is based on parametric calculations and allometric equations, delivering crucial outputs for forest management. The dynamic 3-PG (Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth) is a process-based model (PBM) based on an ecosystem physiological process-based modelling approach. The various applications and flexible nature of the 3-PG model have resulted in its adoption and utilization over several regions of the world. The 3-PGS (Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth with Satellite) model is a modified and spatial version of the 3-PG model that took advantages of remote sensing & GIS (Geographical Information System) for estimation of biophysical variables like FAPAR (Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation), LAI (Leaf area index), and Canopy water content (CWC), which are tedious and laborious to calculate manually. The integration of remote sensing & GIS with PBMs offers insights to predict forest biomass and productivity at a regional level. Also, coupling of the 3-PG/3-PGS model with other modelling and statistical approaches in a GIS environment provides insights into the prediction of species distributions and potential disturbances due to climatic changes. The 3-PG model was originally designed for relatively homogenous forests; but with the recent development, the 3-PGmix has extended its use to mixed species forests. In this review, we have tried to emphasize the general overview, structure, applications, and efficacy of the process-based 3-PG model for forest management. In future, forests and their ecosystem services are expected to be rigorously influenced by climatic variations. Therefore, it is important to understand the role and effectiveness of the forest growth model 3-PG under the influence of climate change. The 3-PG model performs well for a diverse range of conditions for many forest types and species, and could be integrated with other models and approaches in order to widen its functions and applications. Areas such as Fertility Rating (FR), sensitivity and uncertainty of outputs to the model inputs in the 3-PG model requires attention to remove the weaker side, and to increase the effectiveness and accuracy of model outputs. In addition, the model performance can be improved by calculating its parameters from the population of interest, rather than using default values or values from extant literature. Furthermore, high-resolution remote sensing datasets and accurate input field data could increase the accuracy of the 3-PG/3-PGS model predictions at a broad regional level.

A generalised model of forest productivity using simplified concepts of radiation-use efficiency, carbon balance and partitioning. Forest Ecol. Manage. 95, 209–228] is a process-based model using simplified physiological concepts such as light use efficiency, a constant ratio between net and gross primary production and a simple stand nutritional status parameter. This last parameter is commonly adjusted manually to fit observations, based on data from field surveys. It has been shown that nutritional status has a significant effect on estimated gross and net productivity and it has been suggested that the introduction of a soil sub-model could overcome such problems. This paper introduces a soil organic matter decomposition model within the routines of 3-PG. ICBM/2N (Introductory Carbon Balance Model [Andrén, O., Kätterer, T., 1997. ICBM: the introductory carbon balance model for exploration of soil carbon balance. Ecol. Appl. 7, 1226–1236]) was chosen because it operates at a level of complexity similar to 3-PG. The new model 3-PGN (3-PG Nitrogen) includes three soil carbon and three soil nitrogen pools with eleven additional parameters. This approach provides a new way to account for soil nutritional status within 3-PGN by introducing a fertility rating that varies over the life of a stand. We present the integrated model and describe the basic concepts of the integration. The model has been calibrated and tested for commercial plantations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Scotland. An uncertainty analysis was performed based on a Bayesian framework using Monte Carlo simulations and a sensitivity analysis to understand the model’s feedbacks and interactions between parameters and outputs. The results show that the least uncertain parameters were the most sensitive, having the greatest effect on many of 3-PGN’s outputs, including quantum yield efficiency, specific leaf area and foliage:stem biomass partitioning ratio. Although the soil sub-model had no direct effect on productivity, strong non-linear relationships were found between many of the soil parameters and 3-PGN outputs. Root turnover rate was found to be the most uncertain parameter, whereas the ratio of net to gross primary production was the least. Finally, through the validation procedure it was shown that 3-PG’s self-thinning routine may cause problems when predicting the number of stems in stands with low fertility.","2008","2020-05-11 21:47:14","2021-12-07 19:30:34","","1-16","","","219","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>3-PG</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\S99DD8IC\Xenakis et al. - 2008 - Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis from a couple.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Soil; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These permit the modelling of the time-course of growth and development of even-aged, intensively-managed, fertilised stands of Eucalyptus globulus. The parameters were determined by fitting output from 3-PG to observed stem biomass data (i.e. total above-ground woody biomass) and canopy leaf area index (LAI). To fit these data, it was necessary to modify 3-PG by making specific leaf area and the fraction of stem biomass in branch and bark explicitly age-dependent, and to include effects of temperature on canopy quantum efficiency. With these parameter values, 3-PG gave a good description of growth at seven of nine disparate sites in Tasmania and Western Australia. A partial explanation for its failure at one site in Western Australia is that this site was subject to a prolonged drought not reflected in the long-term mean climatic data used in this study. At the other, a high altitude site in Tasmania, 3-PG predicted significant growth although extensive frost damage had prevented establishment of a viable canopy. The model was also applied to non-fertilised stands in northern Tasmania for which only basic growth and site data were available. 3-PG adequately predicted the observed peak MAI of the better sites, but over-estimated peak MAI at poor or high-altitude sites. The following conclusions are drawn: 3-PG can provide a good simulation of future growth of intensively-managed, fertilised stands of E. globulus if the model is initialised with observed biomass data at some age around or following canopy closure. If the model is initialised with typical seedling biomass at planting, 3-PG adequately predicts stem growth rate but not canopy LAI. Further development of 3-PG should take into account possible environmental effects on litterfall, the effects of partial canopy closure during early canopy development, and the prediction of mortality prior to the onset of self-thinning.","2002","2020-05-11 21:44:58","2020-10-08 19:54:05","","273-292","","1-3, 28","163","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>3-PG</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\7JI84LB4\Sands and Landsberg - 2002 - Parameterisation of 3-PG for plantation grown Euca.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model, called 3-PG (use of Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth), calculates total carbon fixed (gross primary production; PG) from utilizable, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (phi-p.a.u.) , obtained by correcting the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the forest canopy (phi-p.a.) for the effects of soil drought, atmospheric vapour pressure deficits and stand age. PG is obtained from phi-p.a.u. and the canopy quantum efficiency, values of which are becoming available. The ratio of net (PN) to gross primary production is emerging as relatively constant for trees. This eliminates the need to calculate respiration and is used to estimate PN - the net amount of carbon converted to biomass. 3-PG uses a simple relationship to estimate the amount of carbon allocated below ground and a procedure based on allometric ratios - widely available for many species and situations - to determine the allocation of carbon to foliage and stems and constrain tree growth patterns. The effects of nutrition are incorporated through the carbon allocation procedure; the amount of carbon allocated below ground will increase with decreasing soil fertility. Recently acquired knowledge about the physiological factors causing decline in forest growth rates with age is used to model that decline. Changes in stem populations self-thinning are derived from a procedure based on the - 3/2 power law, combined with stem growth rates. The model requires weather data as input, works on monthly time steps and has been run for periods up to 120 years, producing realistic patterns of stem growth and stem diameter increments. The time course of leaf area index is realistic for a range of soil conditions and atmospheric constraints. 3-PG can be run from remotely-sensed estimates of leaf area index coupled to weather data and basic, readily available information about soils and stand characteristics. It is being tested as a practical tool against forestry data from New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and New Zealand. Test results show excellent correspondence between stand growth measurements and simulated stem growth over 30 years.","1997","2020-05-11 21:42:27","2021-02-25 19:33:34","","209-228","","","95","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>3-PG</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\IKJXRT9M\Landsberg and Waring - 1997 - A generalised model of forest productivity using s.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Growth; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Information from the report is relevant to climate and carbon research as well as to management practices in North America and around the world. This general overview provides abbreviated highlights of some of the many significant findings from the 19 chapters in SOCCR2.  Carbon Dynamics in North America and the United States in a Global Context Land ecosystems and the ocean play a major role in the removal and sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. From 2007 to 2016, these reservoirs annually removed and stored an average of about 5.4 billion metric tons of carbon that otherwise would have remained in the atmosphere—about half the amount emitted during that period. About 11% to 13% of global ecosystem carbon removal can be attributed to North American ecosystems. Whether the land and ocean will continue to absorb similar amounts of carbon in future years is unclear, since changes in climate, human activities, and ecosystem responses may alter future long-term removals of carbon from the atmosphere. Although North America contributed substantially to global atmospheric carbon emissions over the past decade, its total carbon emissions due to fossil fuel use (referred to in this document as “fossil fuel emissions”) decreased by about 23 million metric tons of carbon per year. Meanwhile, global emissions continued to increase, thus reducing the relative contribution of North America to total fossil fuel emissions from 24% in 2004 to less than 17% in 2013. In addition to reducing the use of fossil fuels, mitigation and management activities in North America and around the world include afforestation and reduced deforestation, restoration of coastal and terrestrial wetlands, and improved land-management practices in forests, grasslands, and croplands. These activities can maintain or increase ecosystem carbon sinks (i.e., carbon storage or removal) while decreasing the sources or emissions of carbon to the atmosphere. However, Arctic warming and disturbances such as pest outbreaks, wildfires, and destruction of wetlands may disrupt and decrease carbon removal, thereby releasing previously removed carbon back to the atmosphere (see Box 2, Why Is the Carbon Cycle Important?).","2018","2020-05-07 15:34:51","2021-12-07 18:37:33","2020-05-07 15:34:51","","","","","","","","","","","","U.S. Global Change Research Program","","en","","","","","Crossref","","DOI: 10.7930/Soccr2.2018","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8DH682Q2\Cavallaro et al. - 2018 - Second State of the Carbon Cycle Report.pdf","","Biomass; Pools; Flux; Aquatic; Reports (non-GTR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A business-as-usual scenario incorporating changing greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations until the year 2089 is compared to a 1975 - 1996 base period. Changes in relative humidity, especially drying over much of the West, are projected to increase the number of days of high fire danger ( based on the energy release component (ERC) index) at least through the year 2089 in comparison to the base period. The regions most affected are the northern Rockies, Great Basin and the Southwest - regions that have already experienced significant fire activity early this century. In these regions starting around the year 2070, when the model climate CO2 has doubled from present-day, the increase in the number of days that ERC ( fuel model G) exceeds a value of 60 is as much as two to three weeks. The Front Range of the Rockies and the High Plains regions do not show a similar change. For regions where change is predicted, new fire and fuels management strategies and policies may be needed to address added climatic risks while also accommodating complex and changing ecosystems subject to human stresses on the region. These results, and their potential impact on fire and land management policy development, demonstrate the value of climatemodels for important management applications, as encouraged under the Department of Energy Accelerated Climate Prediction Initiative ( ACPI), under whose auspices this work was performed.","2004-02","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-05 17:25:56","","365-388","","1-3","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000188531900015","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\P9MPXA7R\Brown et al. - 2004 - The impact of twenty-first century climate change .pdf","","Fire; Management; Modeling; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A compilation of existing root biomass data for upland forests of the world generated a significant regression equation that can be used to predict root biomass based on aboveground biomass only.

For this purpose, background and appendix information is repeated in each chapter. All the chapters follow a template that, after an Executive Summary and Introduction, provide an overview of the corresponding state’s energy and forest sectors using US Energy Information Agency (EIA) and USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, respectively. The chapters then provide information on model parameters, inputs, and modeled scenarios before discussing scenario results. Changes in forest products markets were modeled as a result of changes in forest biomass electricity generation, which results in a change in landscape forest carbon emissions. Forest products markets and carbon emissions were projected using one of two models, depending on the state. Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington scenarios were developed in consultation with state forest and regulatory agencies and analyses performed using the Land Use and Resource Allocation (LURA) model. South Carolina and Virginian scenarios were developed in a similar manner, and analyses were performed using the SubRegional Timber Supply (SRTS) model. Scenario Comparisons While the LURA and SRTS models have similarities, many model assumptions and subsequent analyses differ. Comparison of scenarios within states are valid and represent this report’s most important findings. But model differences and variation in state scenarios prevent valid cross-state comparisons and should be avoided. Also, model results are based almost exclusively on electricity generation; results do not analyze the forest product markets, carbon emission, and land use change impacts of using forest biomass in combined heat and power (CHP) facilities or thermal facilities.","2018","2020-04-30 16:34:23","2021-12-07 19:49:13","","128","","","","","","","","","","","USDA","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\67UC6LAD\Abt et al. - 2018 - Projecting Landscape Forest Carbon Emissions  from.pdf","","Management; Modeling; Wood products; Flux; Oregon; Washington; Reports (non-GTR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two methodologies for estimating the volume and cost of delivered forest residues to a bio-refinery are presented. Both methodologies are based on data provided by the U.S. Forest Service ForestInventory and Analysis (FIA) program.

Acase study assesses four pulp mills, considered as candidate repurposed biorefinery locations, for theirability to procure sufficient biomass under average- and low-yield scenarios utilizing both methods.

Such analyses vary in terms of the degree of spatial, temporal, and activity-level aggregation used to represent forest resources, land cover, and markets. While the statistical and econometric modeling communities widely discuss the effects of aggregation bias and have developed correction techniques, there is limited prior research investigating how aggregation bias may affect structural optimization models. This paper explores potential aggregation bias using the Land Use and Resource Allocation model (LURA), a detailed spatial allocation partial equilibrium model of the U.S. forest sector. We ran a series of projections representing alternative aggregation approaches including averaging forest stocks at plot, county, state, and regional levels, across one-, five, or ten-year age classes, and by two or fourteen forest types. We compared the resulting projections of forest carbon stocks and harvesting activities across each aggregation scenario. This allows us to isolate the effect of aggregation on key variables of interest (e.g., GHG emissions and supply costs), while holding all other structural characteristics of the modeling framework constant. We find that age-class and forest type aggregations have the greatest impact on modeling results, with the potential to substantially impact market and greenhouse gas projections. On the other hand, spatial aggregation has a small impact on national carbon stock projections. Importantly, regional results are greatly impacted by different aggregation approaches, with projected regional cumulative carbon stocks differing by more than 25% across scenarios.","2019","2020-04-30 16:28:53","2020-10-10 00:49:38","","337-366","","","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>LURA</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\P5RA5IXM\Wade et al. - 2019 - Evaluating Potential Sources of Aggregation Bias w.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A portion of these reductions are based on expected sequestration and storage contributions from land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF). Significant uncertainty exists in future forest markets and thus the potential LULUCF contribution to US GHG reduction goals. This study seeks to inform the discussion by modeling US forest GHG accounts per different simulated demand scenarios across a grid of over 130,000 USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) forestland plots over the conterminous United States. This spatially disaggregated future supply is based on empirical yield functions for log volume, biomass and carbon. Demand data is based on a spatial database of over 2300 forest product manufacturing facilities representing 11 intermediate and 13 final solid and pulpwood products. Transportation costs are derived from fuel prices and the locations of FIA plot from which a log is harvested and mill or port destination. Trade between mills in intermediate products such as sawmill residues or planer shavings is also captured within the model formulation. The resulting partial spatial equilibrium model of the US forest sector is solved annually for the period 2015–2035 with demand shifted by energy prices and macroeconomic indicators from the US EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook for a Reference, Low Economic Growth, and High Economic Growth case. For each macroeconomic scenario simulated, figures showing historic and scenario-specific live tree carnon emissions and sequestration are generated.

Identifying how fuel moisture, and subsequent changes in the fire behavior, relates to the production of fire-altered carbon is important in determining how persistent charred residues are following a fire within specific fuel types. Additionally, understanding how mastication (mechanical forest thinning) and fire convert biomass to black carbon is essential for understanding how this management technique, employed in many fire-prone forest types, may influence stand-level black carbon in soils. In this experimental study, 15 masticated fuel beds, conditioned to three fuel moisture ranges, were burned, and production rates of pyrogenic carbon and soot-based black carbon were evaluated. Pyrogenic carbon was determined through elemental analysis of the post-fire residues, and soot-based black carbon was quantified with thermochemical methods. Pyrogenic carbon production rates ranged from 7.23% to 8.67% relative to pre-fire organic carbon content. Black carbon production rates averaged 0.02% in the 4–8% fuel moisture group and 0.05% in the 13–18% moisture group. A comparison of the ratio of black carbon to pyrogenic carbon indicates that burning with fuels ranging from 13%to 15% moisture content resulted in a higher proportion of black carbon produced, suggesting that the precursors to black carbon were indiscriminately consumed at lower fuel moistures. This research highlights the importance of fuel moisture and its role in dictating both the quantity and quality of the carbon produced in masticated fuel beds.","2013-03","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-04-28 19:04:52","2019-05-13 23:06:33","30-40","","1","118","","","Fuel moisture influences on fire-altered carbon in masticated fuels","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\6BFX4GNV\Brewer et al. - 2013 - Fuel moisture influences on fire-altered carbon in.pdf","","Fire; Biomass; Black carbon; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of particular concern is regional-scale mortality of overstory trees, which rapidly alters ecosystem type, associated ecosystem properties, and land surface conditions for decades. Here, we quantify regional-scale vegetation die-off across southwestern North American woodlands in 2002-2003 in response to drought and associated bark beetle infestations. At an intensively studied site within the region, we quantified that after 15 months of depleted soil water content, >90% of the dominant, overstory tree species (Pinus edulis, a pinon) died. The die-off was reflected in changes in a remotely sensed index of vegetation greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation index), not only at the intensively studied site but also across the region, extending over 12,000 km(2) or more; aerial and field surveys confirmed the general extent of the die-off. Notably, the recent drought was warmer than the previous subcontinental drought of the 1950s. The limited, available observations suggest that die-off from the recent drought was more extensive than that from the previous drought, extending into wetter sites within the tree species' distribution. Our results quantify a trigger leading to rapid, drought-induced die-off of overstory woody plants at subcontinental scale and highlight the potential for such die-off to be more severe and extensive for future global-change-type drought under warmer conditions.","2005-10-18","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-05 16:59:47","","15144-15148","","42","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000232811800038","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8RJMZ9DI\Breshears et al. - 2005 - Regional vegetation die-off in response to global-.pdf","","Journal Article; Mortality; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The savings associated with these benefits vary by climate region and can be up to $200 per tree. The cost of planting trees and maintaining them can vary from $10 to $500 per tree. Tree-planting programs can be designed to have lower costs so that they offer potential savings to communities that plant trees. Our calculations suggest that urban trees play a major role in sequestering CO, and thereby delay global warming. We estimate that a tree planted in Los Angeles avoids the combustion of 18 kg of carbon annually, even though it sequesters only 4.5-11 kg (as it would if growing in a forest). In this sense, one shade tree in Los Angeles is equivalent to three to five forest trees. In a recent analysis for Baton Rouge, Sacramento, and Salt Lake City, we estimated that planting an average of four shade trees per house (each with a top view cross section of 50 m(2)) would lead to an annual reduction in carbon emissions from power plants of 16,000, 41,000, and 9000 t, respectively (the per-tree reduction in carbon emissions is about 10-11 kg per year). These reductions only account for the direct reduction in the net cooling- and heating-energy use of buildings. Once the impact of the community cooling is included, these savings are increased by at least 25%. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Carbon and SOM quantity and quality were measured in the O horizon and mineral soil to 50 cm in five treatments (control, double litter [DL], no litter [NL], no roots [NR], no inputs [NI]). After two decades of doubled litter addition, soil C and SOM did not increase. However, leaf litter exclusions reduced soil C (O and mineral horizons combined) by 24% in NL and 33% in NI treatments. In the mineral soil, the largest declines occurred in the 0- to 10-cm depth (0.93-2.01 kg C m(-2)), although losses were observed throughout the entire solum. The NR treatments showed no losses of C. Thermal characterization of SOM quality differed among treatments in the 0-to 10-cm depth. Patterns of CO2 evolution during SOM combustion revealed differences in SOM quality between surface and deeper horizons. Our work shows that the sources of litter are important in controlling soil C. Leaf litter made important contributions to maintaining current stocks of soil C; increased leaf litter did not increase soil C, but decreases in litter inputs resulted in rapid soil C declines. Root litter may ultimately provide more stable sources of soil C. Management activities or environmental alterations that decrease litter inputs in mature forests can lower soil C content; however, increases in forest productivity and the resulting increased litter production seem unlikely to increase soil C sequestration.","2014","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2021-12-07 19:14:05","","S66-S75","","","78","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000356789100007","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\EBHZ3A64\Bowden et al. - 2014 - Litter Input Controls on Soil Carbon in a Temperat.pdf","","Management; Pools; Journal Article; Flux; Soil; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus we use a global ocean biogeochemical model to assess the coastal ocean’s global inventory of anthropogenic CO2 and its spatial variability.We used an intermediate resolution, eddying version of the NEMOPISCES model (ORCA05), varying from 20 to 50 km horizontally, i.e. coarse enough to allow multiple centuryscale simulations but finer than coarse-resolution models (~200 km) to better resolve coastal bathymetry and complex coastal currents.

Evaluation of the simulated air–sea fluxes of total CO2 for 45 coastal regions gave a correlation coefficient R of 0.8 when compared to observation-based estimates. Simulated global uptake of anthropogenic carbon results averaged 2.3 PgCyr-1 during the years 1993–2012, consistent with previous estimates. Yet only 0.1 PgCyr-1 of that is absorbed by the global coastal ocean. That represents 4.5% of the anthropogenic carbon uptake of the global ocean, less than the 7.5% proportion of coastal-to-global-ocean surface areas. Coastal uptake is weakened due to a bottleneck in offshore transport, which is inadequate to reduce the mean anthropogenic carbon concentration of coastal waters to the mean level found in the open-ocean mixed layer.","2016","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2020-10-05 16:48:18","","4167-4185","","14","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\UFHAIB7H\Bourgeois et al. - 2016 - Coastal-ocean Uptake of Anthropogenic Carbon.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Flux; Aquatic; Sea; Transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"FXMVJC75","report","2008","Bonnicksen, Thomas M","Greenhouse gas emissions from four california wildfires: opportunities to prevent and reverse environmental and climate impacts","","","","","","Executive Summary Forests and forestry are playing an increasingly important role in sequestering carbon and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, especially during a period of rising concerns about global warming. The Forest Carbon and Emissions Model (FCEM) used in this study estimates forest carbon storage, sequestration, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using equations from recognized scientific sources. The purpose of this report is to provide estimates that illustrate the impact of wildfires on greenhouse gas emissions and the importance of thinning forests to protect forests and communities, and to prevent emissions from combustion and decay. It also focuses on the significance of removing dead trees and replanting to restore forests and recover greenhouse gases released by wildfire. Reducing the Threat of Wildfires Some people argue that we have to live with fire. On the contrary, an industrialized world can’t live with fire. We would have to move out of our forests to be safe and get out of our cars to eliminate tailpipe emissions to make up for the greenhouse gases that wildfires emit into the atmosphere, and that isn’t realistic. The only solution is to fight global warming and protect our communities and forests by reducing the threat of catastrophic wildfires. The Angora Fire of 2007 blackened 3,100 acres of forest and destroyed 254 homes in the Tahoe Basin because most of the forest was so dense. Using pre-fire data for the forest, FCEM estimates that combustion emissions could have been lowered from 46.2 tons per acre to 12 tons per acre if the density of trees had been reduced from 273 per acre to the more natural density of 60 per acre. A fire burning in the same forest after thinning would not have been catastrophic. It would have killed few large trees, covered less acreage, and left adjacent communities relatively unharmed. That is what could have been, but it also illustrates the opportunity that still exists to fight global warming and protect the rest of the Tahoe Basin as well as other forests and communities in California and the West. Climate Impacts of Wildfires This report analyzes four catastrophic California wildfires using FCEM: the Angora, Fountain, Moonlight, and Star Fires. Together these wildfires burned over 144,825 acres of forestland. Those who have not stood in the midst of flames 200-feet high, felt the overwhelming heat from a temperature more than 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and smelled the smoke and gases released, cannot fully appreciate a catastrophic wildfire. It is awesome and terrible, and firefighters who brave these conditions deserve our respect. The catastrophic wildfires that ravage California each year don’t resemble the historic fires that took place in these forests for millennia. Most natural fires didn’t sweep across landscapes destroying whole forests as wildfires do today. The underlying cause of modern catastrophic wildfires is too many trees. The four forests burned by these wildfires were overcrowded with trees - with trees of all sizes intermixed to form a uniform mass of fuel spreading over the landscape. They averaged 350 trees per acre when 50-60 trees per acre would be natural. They also contained unnaturally heavy surface fuels composed of litter, duff, down dead wood, shrubs, and small trees that ranged from an estimated 25 to 40 tons per acre. Tree density, especially young trees growing under larger trees as ladder fuel, and surface fuels are the two most important contributors to the size and severity of wildfires. Consequently, when the massive amounts of fuel in these forests burned, they released an estimated 9.5 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere just from combustion. That is an average of about 63 tons per acre. However, combustion is only part of the story because dead trees also gradually release CO2 as they decay. CO2 emissions from decay are generally three times greater than emissions from combustion because large quantities of wood and other plant material remain unburned after a forest fire. Combining combustion and decay emissions, FCEM estimates that these four fires will emit a staggering 38 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The fires released one fourth of the gases during combustion, and post-fire decay will release the remainder during the next 100 years, most of it during the next 50 years. To put these emissions from combustion and decay into perspective, they are equivalent to adding an estimated 7 million more cars onto California’s highways for one year, each spewing tons of greenhouse gases out the tailpipe. Stated another way, this means 50 percent of all cars in California would have to be locked in a garage for one year to make up for the global warming impact of these four wildfires. Opportunities for Action One way to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions from wildfires is to lower the amount of biomass available for decay. Removing dead trees and storing the carbon they contain in the solid wood products consumers need can reduce total CO2 emissions by as much as 15 percent. Planting a young forest to replace one killed by wildfire and letting the growing trees absorb CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis is another way. Doing both, especially with interim harvests for wood products after planting, effectively reverses the impact of wildfire emissions on global warming. This report estimates accomplishments, planned and completed, to reduce and recover greenhouse gas emissions from four areas blackened by catastrophic wildfires in California. So far, FCEM estimates that these actions, in combination, will compensate for 42 to 114 percent of the actual and potential CO2 losses caused by three of the four wildfires. Even so, opportunities still exist to do even more to restore two of the four forests burned and fight global warming. In particular, removing dead trees and planting national forest lands burned by the 2007 Angora and Moonlight Fires could recover an estimated 98 to more than 100 percent of the CO2 losses they caused. Equally important, these actions would help protect surrounding communities from a second wildfire or re-burn, which often occurs in forests that become dead-tree filled brush fields. The immensity of greenhouse gas emissions from just these four wildfires is a warning. Clearly, we must make every effort to reduce the amount of excess biomass in forests to prevent catastrophic wildfires. That means decreasing the number of trees by thinning to make them more resistant to crown fires, which will also restore the natural health and diversity of our forests. Reducing the number and severity of wildfires may be the single most important action we can take in the short-term to lower greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming.","2008","2020-02-07 17:42:41","2021-03-02 23:13:58","","19","","","","","","","","","","FCEM Report","The Forest Foundation","Auburn, California","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\EGPIRE67\Bonnicksen - 2008 - Greenhouse gas emissions from four california wild.pdf","","Fire; Modeling; California; Reports (non-GTR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Geophys. Res","","","doi:10.1029/2010JG001593","","The Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) overestimates gross primary production (GPP) compared with data-driven estimates and other process models. We use global, spatially gridded GPP and latent heat flux upscaled from the FLUXNET network of eddy covariance towers to evaluate and improve canopy processes in CLM4. We investigate differences in GPP and latent heat flux arising from model parameterizations (termed model structural error) and from uncertainty in the photosynthetic parameter Vcmax (termed model parameter uncertainty). Model structural errors entail radiative transfer, leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, and canopy scaling of leaf processes. Model structural revisions reduce global GPP over the period 1982 - 2004 from 165 Pg C yr -1 to 130 Pg C yr -1, and global evapotranspiration decreases from 68,000 km3 yr -1 to 65,000 km3 yr -1, within the uncertainty of FLUXNET - based estimates. Colimitation of photosynthesis is a cause of the improvements, as are revisions to photosynthetic parameters and their temperature dependency. Improvements are seen in all regions and seasonally over the course of the year. Similar improvements occur in latent heat flux. Uncertainty in Vcmax produces effects of comparable magnitude as model structural errors, but of offsetting sign. This suggests that model structural errors can be compensated by parameter adjustment, and this may explain the lack of consensus in values for Vcmax used in terrestrial biosphere models. Our analyses show that despite inherent uncertainties global flux fields empirically inferred from FLUXNET data are a valuable tool to guide terrestrial biosphere model development and evaluation.","2011","2020-03-20 22:33:44","2021-03-04 18:54:00","","","","G02014","116","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>CLM4</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\IA6LSQKZ\Bonan et al. - 2011 - Improving canopy processes in the Community Land M.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overall, FF stocks were 38% higher under conifers, mineral SOC stocks were similar, and whole soil SOC was 14% higher under conifers. An analysis with six of the seven most reported tree genera reaffirmed higher FF and whole soil C stocks under conifer stands. Analysis with all seven of the genera showed more pronounced variability in mineral SOC results compared with the overall results. Eucalyptus was the only hardwood that stored significantly (17%) more SOC in the mineral soil than adjacent conifers. Picea was the only conifer that stored significantly (7%) more SOC in the mineral soil than hardwoods. Differences in FF SOC stocks had a limited predictive power in explaining the variability of mineral SOC stock differences, suggesting that they are not very closely linked with regard to SOC storage. Only when comparing FF SOC stocks among genera did precipitation, age difference, soil texture, and previous land use moderate SOC storage differences between conifers and hardwoods. In other cases, neither climate nor soil variables could explain differences between SOC stocks. Our findings suggest that using plant-trait-driven vegetation categories may be a more descriptive way of detecting vegetation effects on SOC.","2014","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-01 23:03:06","","S35-S47","","","78","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000356789100004","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\XFDMJKFL\Boca et al. - 2014 - Forest Overstory Effect on Soil Organic Carbon Sto.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Soil; Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While severity and extent of fires drives overall emissions, methods for accurately estimating fire severity are poorly tested in this unique region where organic soil combustion is responsible for a large proportion of total emissions. We tested a method using adventitious roots on black spruce trees (Picea mariana) in combination with canopy allometry to reconstruct prefire organic soil layers and canopy biomass in boreal black spruce forests of Alaska (USA), thus providing a basis for more accurately quantifying fire severity levels. We calibrated this adventitious-root-height method in unburned spruce stands and then tested it by comparing our biomass and soils estimates reconstructed in burned stands with actual prefire stand measurements. We applied this approach to 3 8 black spruce stands burned in 2004 in Alaska, where we measured organic soil and stand characteristics and estimated the amount of soil and canopy biomass, as well as C and N pools, consumed by fire. These high-intensity quantitative estimates of severity were significantly correlated to a semiquantitative visual rapid assessment tool, the composite burn index (CB I). This index has proved useful for assessing fire severity in forests in the western United States but has not yet been widely tested in the boreal forest. From our study, we conclude that using postfire measurements of adventitious roots on black spruce trees in combination with soils and tree data can be used to reconstruct prefire organic soil depths and biomass pools, providing accurate estimates of fire severity and emissions. Furthermore, using our quantitative reconstruction we show that CBl is a reasonably good predictor of biomass and soil C loss at these sites, and it shows promise for rapidly estimating fire severity across a wide range of boreal black spruce forest types, especially where the use of high-intensity measurements may be limited by cost and time.","2010-09","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-04-28 17:34:26","2019-05-13 23:10:14","1633-1647","","6","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ASQPV3N4\Boby et al. - 2010 - Quantifying fire severity, carbon, and nitrogen em.pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; Alaska; Flux; Boreal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"N7S3Z2ST","report","1992","Birdsey, Richard A","Carbon Storage and Accumulation in United States Forest Ecosystems","","","","","","Historically, assessments of the forest resource situation have focused on timber supply, and the data used to support the assessments came from traditional forest inventories designed to provide reliable estimates of timber volume, growth, removals, and mortality (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service 1982). The most recent assessment included data and analysis of forest resources other than timber, including wildlife, range, water, recreation, and other resources associated with the Nation's forest lands (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service 1989). Future forest resource assessments will include expanded analyses of environmental issues such as the effects of acid deposition on forest health, the prospective effects of global warming on forests, and the impacts of prospective strategies to mitigate or adapt to changing environmental conditions.  A key issue analyzed in the 1989 Resources Planning Act (RPA) Assessment is the impact of climate change on America's forests (Joyce and others 1990). Another issue undergoing intense analysis at this time but not included in the 1989 RPA Assessment is the evaluation of forestry opportunities for mitigating the effects of global warming. Analysis of forestry opportunities requires knowledge of carbon storage and accumulation in forest ecosystems. It is the purpose of this publication to provide estimates of carbon storage and accumulation for U.S. forests. Because it takes years to design and conduct detailed inventories of U.S. forest lands, the only way to satisfy current, expanding information needs is to integrate the best available data from the national inventory sample with data from special studies of selected forest ecosystems.","1992-08","2020-02-07 18:32:29","2020-10-01 23:12:12","","55","","","","","","","","","","General Technical Report","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Washington Office","Washington, DC","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\R3FNG48C\Birdsey - 1992 - Carbon Storage and Accumulation in United States F.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; GTR; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GTR-WO-59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goals of this paper are to review the capability of ongoing operational inventory programs for estimating forest carbon stocks and stock changes, and to identify opportunities to improve forest carbon monitoring by enhancing these programs and supplementing them with new monitoring capability. Carbon in forest ecosystems and wood products cannot be measured directly. Ongoing forest monitoring programs provide a statistical basis for estimating carbon stocks and stock changes, based on data already collected, with a temporal resolution of about 5 years. Improvements in inventories will shorten the reporting cycle and add some variables that enhance the content with respect to carbon estimation, but it will take about a decade for full implementation. Meanwhile, there is an important role for remote sensing measurements, modeling, and imputation techniques to fill gaps in spatial coverage and content. Elements of the proposed North American Carbon Program, if implemented, will improve the estimates of forest ecosystem carbon.","2004-07","2019-10-29 21:41:26","2020-10-01 23:03:06","","S1-S8","","","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000203094700001","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\MWBVSIA9\Birdsey - 2004 - Data gaps for monitoring forest carbon in the unit.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wildfire impacts on chemistry were evaluated by examining solute chemistry in four catchments from 2002 to 2007. Ecosystem metabolism was measured over the summer of 2005 in one burned and two unburned catchments. Wildfire led to stream nitrate concentration increasing up to threefold, whereas dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations decreased post-fire. Average stream gross primary production in the burned catchment was double that of the unburned sites (2.4 and 1.2 g O2 m-2 day, respectively). Respiration rate was also elevated in the burned stream (6.6 g O2 m-2 day-1) compared with the control streams (l.2 and 4.5 g O2 m-2 day-1).

We modeled fire severity conditions for the entire area burned in large fires during a large fire year (2004) to determine the factors that are most important in estimating severity and to identify areas affected by deep-burning fires. In addition to standard methods of assessing severity using spectral information, we incorporated information regarding topography, spatial pattern of burning, and instantaneous characteristics such as fire weather and fire radiative power. Ensemble techniques using regression trees as a base learner were able to determine fire severity successfully using spectral data in concert with other relevant geospatial data. This method was successful in estimating average conditions, but it underestimated the range of severity. This new approach was used to identify black spruce stands that experienced intermediate- to high-severity fires in 2004 and are therefore susceptible to a shift in regrowth toward deciduous dominance or mixed dominance. Based on the output of the severity model, we estimate that 39% (-4000 km') of all burned black spruce stands in 2004 had < 10 cm of residual organic layer and may be susceptible a postfire shift in plant functional type dominance, as well as permafrost loss. If the fraction of area susceptible to deciduous regeneration is constant for large fire years, the effect of such years in the most recent decade has been to reduce black spruce stands by 4.2% and to increase areas dominated or co-dominated by deciduous forest stands by 20%.

Across this region, wildfires influence the temporal and spatial dynamics of carbon storage. In this study, we estimate fire emissions and changes in carbon storage for boreal North America over the 21st century. We use a gridded data set developed with a multivariate adaptive regression spline approach to determine how area burned varies each year with changing climatic and fuel moisture conditions. We apply the process-based Terrestrial Ecosystem Model to evaluate the role of future fire on the carbon dynamics of boreal North America in the context of changing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and climate in the A2 and B2 emissions scenarios of the CGCM2 global climate model. Relative to the last decade of the 20th century, decadal total carbon emissions from fire increase by 2.5-4.4 times by 2091-2100, depending on the climate scenario and assumptions about CO2 fertilization. Larger fire emissions occur with warmer climates or if CO2 fertilization is assumed to occur. Despite the increases in fire emissions, our simulations indicate that boreal North America will be a carbon sink over the 21st century if CO2 fertilization is assumed to occur in the future.

Hopkinson et al. (2008) showed that it is possible to detect growth using repeated LiDAR collections for a pine plantation in Ontario, Canada. Plot-level field measures of forest height increment paralleled corresponding changes in LiDAR height, indicating that it may be possible to track forest growth by monitoring change in LiDAR metrics from year to year. Yu et al. (2008) constructed difference metrics by subtracting LiDAR variables derived from repeat LiDAR collections. Using these as predictor variables in a linear regression, they showed that forest height and volume increment can be predicted moderately well in a boreal forest in Finland. Hudak et al. (2012) developed biomass maps for two LiDAR acquisitions over a mixed conifer forest in Idaho, USA and showed that, even when LiDAR point densities differed dramatically between the datasets, it was possible to estimate change in biomass by subtracting the two predicted maps. Considering the demonstrated ability of multi-temporal LiDAR to estimate forest growth, it is not surprising that there is great interest in developing forest carbon monitoring strategies that rely on repeated LiDAR acquisitions for remote areas. Allowing for sparser field campaigns, LiDAR stands to make monitoring forest carbon cheaper and more efficient than field-only sampling procedures. There are issues concerning the few procedures currently proposed to assess growth, and subsequently carbon flux, using multi-temporal LiDAR though. Most linear regression approaches implicitly assume that remote sensing and field data are collected in the same season, which is problematic for most large-area field inventory campaigns. To increase spatial field sampling coverage without incurring extra cost, typically, only portions of the network of permanent sample plots are remeasured each year. Since the LiDAR and field data need to be coincident for proper calibration, the researcher is forced to discard all inventory data from other years or otherwise assume temporal misalignments to be negligible. We need methods capable of using temporally disjointed data appropriately. Further, subtracting maps of separately predicted forest biomass does not allow for prediction uncertainty to be properly carried through to the estimation of carbon flux. Without an accurate and useful assessment of carbon flux uncertainty, we have no way of understanding if predicted values are reliable. Here, we look to the spatio-temporally data-rich Kenai Peninsula in Alaska, USA to examine the potential for Bayesian spatio-temporal mapping of terrestrial forest carbon storage and uncertainty. The modeling framework explored here can predict forest carbon through space and time, while formally propagating uncertainty through to prediction. Bayesian spatio-temporal models are flexible frameworks allowing for forest growth processes to be formally integrated into the model. By incorporating a mechanism for growth---using temporally repeated field and LiDAR data---we can more fully exploit the information-rich field inventory network to improve prediction","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-04-28 17:04:53","","42-44","","","","","","","","","","New Directions in Inventory Techniques & Applications Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) Symposium 2015","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\4ELE6JZA\Babcock et al. - 2015 - A Bayesian hierarchical model for spatio-temporal .pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; GTR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hydrological and biogeochemical data from this site and other Pacific Northwest forest ecosystems were used to calibrate the model. Model parameters were first calibrated to simulate the postfire buildup of ecosystem carbon and nitrogen stocks in plants and soil from 1525 to 1969, the year when stream flow and chemistry measurements were begun.

The interaction of hydrological and biogeochemical processes in the model provided a means for interpreting these changes. Results show that (1) losses of dissolved nutrients in the preharvest old-growth forest were generally low and consisted primarily of organic nitrogen and carbon; (2) following harvest, carbon and nitrogen losses from the terrestrial system to the stream and atmosphere increased as a result of reduced plant nitrogen uptake, increased soil organic matter decomposition, and high soil moisture; and (3) the rate of forest regrowth following harvest was lower than that after fire because post-clear-cut stocks and turnover of detritus nitrogen were substantially lower than after fire.","2013-03","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 19:39:55","2019-05-13 23:04:59","1292-1313","","3","49","","","Effects of harvest on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in a Pacific Northwest forest catchment","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\329MS45Q\Abdelnour et al. - 2013 - Effects of harvest on carbon and nitrogen dynamics.pdf","","Management; Modeling; Journal Article; Aquatic; Transfer; Oregon; Harvest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overall goals of the Fall River study are to assess effects of biomass removals, soil compaction, tillage, and vegetation control on site properties and growth of planted Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). Biomass-removal treatments included removal of commercial bole (BO), bole to 5-cm top diameter (BO5), total tree (TT), and total tree plus all legacy woody debris (TT+). Vegetation control (VC) effects were tested in BO, while soil compaction and compaction plus tillage were imposed in BO+VC treatment. All treatments were imposed in 1999. The preharvest stand contained similar amounts of carbon (C) above the mineral soil (292 Mg/ha) as within the mineral soil to 80cm depth including roots (298 Mg/ha). Carbon stores above the mineral soil ordered by size were live trees (193 Mg/ha), old-growth logs (37 Mg/ha), forest floor (27 Mg/ha), old-growth stumps and snags (17 Mg/ha), coarse woody debris (11 Mg/ha), dead trees/snags (7 Mg/ha), and understory vegetation (0.1 Mg/ha). The mineral soil to 80-cm depth contained 248 Mg C/ha, and roots added 41 Mg/ha. Total nitrogen (N) in mineral soil and roots (13 349 kg/ha) was more than 10 times the N store above the mineral soil (1323 kg/ha). Postharvest C above mineral soil decreased to 129, 120, 63, and 50 Mg/ha in BO, BO5, TT, and TT+, respectively.

With climate change, fire frequencies may increase, resulting in a larger fraction of the boreal landscape present in early-successional stages. Since most fertilization studies have focused on mature boreal forests, the response of burned boreal ecosystems to increased nutrient availability is unclear. Therefore, we used a nitrogen N) fertilization experiment to test how ( cycling in a recently-burned boreal ecosystem would respond to increased N availability. We hypothesized that fertilization would increase rates of decomposition, soil respiration, and the activity of extracellular enzymes involved in C cycling, thereby reducing soil ( stocks. In line with our hypothesis, litter mass loss increased significantly and activities of cellulose- and chitin-degrading enzymes increased by 45-61% with N addition. We also observed a significant decline in C concentra­tions in the organic soil horizon from 19.5 ± 0.7% to 13.5 ± 0.6%, and there was a trend toward lower total soil ( stocks in the fertilized plots. Contrary to our hypothesis, mean soil respiration over three growing C seasons declined by 31% from 78.3 ± 6.5 mg (Or( m-2 h-I to 54.4 ± 4.1 mg OrC m-2 h-1 These changes occurred despite a 2.5-fold increase in aboveground net primary productivity with N, and were accompanied by significant shifts in the structure of the fungal community, which was dominated by Ascomycota. Our results show that the C cycle in early-successional boreal ecosystems is highly responsive to N addition. Fertilization results in an initial loss of soil C followed by depletion of soil C substrates and development of a distinct and active fungal community. Total microbial biomass declines and respiration rates do not keep pace with plant inputs. These patterns suggest that N fertilization could transiently reduce but then increase ecosystem C storage in boreal regions experiencing more frequent fires.","2010-07","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-03-04 00:54:30","2019-05-13 23:09:15","1157-1164","","7","42","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\VCV8TNHT\Allison et al. - 2010 - Nitrogen alters carbon dynamics during early succe.pdf","","Journal Article; Alaska; Flux; Soil; Boreal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast to previous reports, the current study modelled landscape scale effects of fuel treatments on fire spread and intensity, and used a probabilistic framework to quantify wildfire effects on carbon pools to account for stochastic wildfire occurrence. The study area was a 68 474 ha watershed located on the Fremont-Winema National Forest in southeastern Oregon, USA. Fuel reduction treatments were simulated on 10% of the watershed (19% of federal forestland). We simulated 30 000 wildfires with random ignition locations under both treated and untreated landscapes to estimate the change in bum probability by flame length class resulting from the treatments. Carbon loss functions were then calculated with the Forest Vegetation Simulator for each stand in the study area to quantity change in carbon as a function of flame length. We then calculated the expected change in carbon from a random ignition and wildfire as the sum of the product of the carbon loss and the bum probabilities by flame length class. The expected carbon difference between the nontreatment and treatment scenarios was then calculated to quantify the effect of fuel treatments. Overall, the results show that the carbon loss from implementing fuel reduction treatments exceeded the expected carbon benefit associated with lowered bum probabilities and reduced fire severity on the treated landscape. Thus, fuel management activities resulted in an expected net loss of carbon immediately after treatment. However, the findings represent a point in time estimate (wildfire immediately after treatments), and a temporal analysis with a probabilistic framework used here is needed to model carbon dynamics over the life cycle of the fuel treatments. Of particular importance is the longterm balance between emissions from the decay of dead trees killed by fire and carbon sequestration by forest regeneration following wildfire.","2010-12-07","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-04-28 16:46:38","2019-05-13 23:08:27","2515-2526","","12","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ASLP8SL5\Ager et al. - 2010 - Measuring the effect of fuel treatments on forest .pdf","","Fire; Modeling; Journal Article; Oregon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under an offset sales program, on-the-ground forestry could change as a result of both afforestation and modifications in the management of existing forests. These effects could vary markedly by region in the United States because of differences in areas of agricultural land suitable for afforestation, forest carbon and volume growth characteristics, the structure of landownerhip, and forest industry concentration. Using a dynamic model of North American markets, our analysis of alternative carbon price levels suggests that the largest carbon increment response would come from changes in forest management: extending rotations, shifting silvicultural regimes, and reforestation to hardwood forest types (in some regions). Carbon payment could also stimulate a substantial afforestation response in eastern regions (North and South). Afforestation is particularly important in the North where timberland area could expand markedly. Much of the area would be planted to hardwoods, stemming the projected decline in hardwood forest types and growing stock volume.","2011","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 19:45:09","","444-453","","8","109","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\78B7D2CH\Adams et al. - 2011 - Regional impacts of a program for private forest c.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Offset; Policy; Silviculture; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Post-fire biomass dynamics have rarely been observed directly for high-elevation forests of the Pacific Northwest. We examined changes in total biomass and its components (attrition of coarse woody debris (CWD), growth of shrubs and herbaceous plants, and tree recruitment) over the first 15 years following wildfire in a mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) forest in Oregon, using permanent plots representing random samples of four levels of fire-severity, from unburned to >90% tree mortality. Understory vegetation was transformed by fire, inasmuch as only shrubs were detected in unburned plots, while burned plots also had significant amounts of graminoids and forbs. Conifer recruitment was sparse in plots with high fire-severity two years after fire, but was abundant after 15 years. Recruitment was predominantly mountain hemlock and most were seedlings <1 m tall. The breakage of snags and resulting increase in logs created microsites (north sides of logs) conducive to tree regeneration. Mass of understory vegetation and conifer regeneration was far outweighed by CWD. Toppling, fragmentation, and advancing decay of snags resulted in a decrease in snag mass and an increase in log mass. The loss of snag mass exceeded the increase in log mass, resulting in an overall decline. For some portions of the burned area, particularly areas of high fire-severity, it may be more than a century before the growth of live trees balances the loss of mass of CWD.

Models predict that some portion of this release will be offset by increased production of Arctic and boreal biomass; however, the lack of robust estimates of net carbon balance increases the risk of further overshooting international emissions targets. Precise empirical or model-based assessments of the critical factors driving carbon balance are unlikely in the near future, so to address this gap, we present estimates from 98 permafrost region experts of the response of biomass, wildfire, and hydrologic carbon flux to climate change. Results suggest that contrary to model projections, total permafrost region biomass could decrease due to water stress and disturbance, factors that are not adequately incorporated in current models. Assessments indicate that end-of-the century organic carbon release from Arctic rivers and collapsing coastlines could increase by 75% while carbon loss via burning could increase four-fold. Experts identified water balance, shifts in vegetation community, and permafrost degradation as the key sources of uncertainty in predicting future system response. In combination with previous findings, results suggest the permafrost region will become a carbon source to the atmosphere by 2100 regardless of warming scenario but that 65%–85% of permafrost carbon release can still be avoided if human emissions are actively reduced.","2016","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2023-03-24 16:45:38","","034014","","3","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QGVYQRV6\Abbott et al. - 2016 - Biomass offsets little or none of permafrost carbo.pdf","","Fire; Biomass; Journal Article; Soil; Aquatic; Perfmafrost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach notably retains information on the spatial distribution of NEE, or the vertical exchange between land and atmosphere of all non-fossil fuel sources and sinks of CO2, while accounting for lateral transfers of forest and crop products as well as their eventual emissions. The total NEE estimate of a -327 ± 252 TgC yr-1 sink for NA was driven primarily by CO2 uptake in the Forest Lands sector (-248 TgC yr-1), largely in the Northwest and Southeast regions of the US, and in the Crop Lands sector (-297 TgC yr-1), predominantly in the Midwest US states. These sinks are counteracted by the carbon source estimated for the Other Lands sector (+218 TgC yr-1), where much of the forest and crop products are assumed to be returned to the atmosphere (through livestock and human consumption). The ecosystems of Mexico are estimated to be a small net source (+18 TgC yr-1) due to land use change between 1993 and 2002. We compare these inventorybased estimates with results from a suite of terrestrial biosphere and atmospheric inversion models, where the mean continental-scale NEE estimate for each ensemble is -511 TgC yr -1 and -931 TgC yr-1, respectively. In the modeling approaches, all sectors, including Other Lands, were generally estimated to be a carbon sink, driven in part by assumed CO2 fertilization and/or lack of consideration of carbon sources from disturbances and product emissions. Additional fluxes not measured by the inventories, although highly uncertain, could add an additional -239 TgC yr-1 to the inventory-based NA sink estimate, thus suggesting some convergence with the modeling approaches.","2012-04","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2020-10-07 00:00:02","","1282-1299","","4","18","","Global Change Biol","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000301533100007","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\BUHL3ZRQ\Hayes et al. - 2012 - Reconciling Estimates of the Contemporary North Am.pdf","","Carbon Cycle; Modeling; Journal Article; Flux; Agriculture; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the northern permafrost region, organic soils (peatlands) and cryoturbated permafrost-affected mineral soils have the highest mean soil organic carbon contents (32.2–69.6 kg m 2). Here we report a new estimate of the carbon pools in soils of the northern permafrost region, including deeper layers and pools not accounted for in previous analyses. Carbon pools were estimated to be 191.29 Pg for the 0–30 cm depth, 495.80 Pg for the 0–100 cm depth, and 1024.00 Pg for the 0–300 cm depth. Our estimate for the first meter of soil alone is about double that reported for this region in previous analyses. Carbon pools in layers deeper than 300 cm were estimated to be 407 Pg in yedoma deposits and 241 Pg in deltaic deposits. In total, the northern permafrost region contains approximately 1672 Pg of organic carbon, of which approximately 1466 Pg, or 88%, occurs in perennially frozen soils and deposits.

While many aspects of the North American carbon budget have been intensively studied, the net contribution of fire disturbance to the overall net carbon flux at the continental scale remains uncertain. Based on national scale, spatially explicit and long-term fire data, along with the improved model parameterization in a process-based ecosystem model, we simulated the impact of fire disturbance on both direct carbon emissions and net terrestrial ecosystem carbon balance in North America. Fire caused direct carbon emissions were 106.55 ± 15.98 Tg C/yr during 1990–2012; however, the net ecosystem carbon balance associated with fire was -26.09 ± 5.22 Tg C/yr, indicating that most of the emitted carbon was resequestered by the terrestrial ecosystem. Direct carbon emissions showed an increase in Alaska and Canada during 1990–2012 as compared to prior periods due to more extreme fire events, resulting in a large carbon source from these two regions. Among biomes, the largest carbon source was found to be from the boreal forest, primarily due to large reductions in soil organic matter during, and with slower recovery after, fire events. The interactions between fire and environmental factors reduced the fire caused ecosystem carbon source. Fire disturbance only caused a weak carbon source as compared to the best estimate terrestrial carbon sink in North America owing to the long-term legacy effects of historical burn area coupled with fast ecosystem recovery during 1990–2012.","2017","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-12-07 19:54:36","","878-900","","5","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\CS3XRZU9\Chen et al. - 2017 - Contributions of wildland fire to terrestrial ecos.pdf","","Carbon Cycle; Fire; Journal Article; Processes; Flux; Growth; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we apply the Biome-BGC model over the four-state Northwest US region for the interval from 1986 to 2010. Landsat data were used to characterize disturbances, and forest inventory data were used to parameterize the model. The overall disturbance rate on forest land across the region was 0.8 % year-1, with 49 % as harvests, 28 % as fire, and 23 % as pest/pathogen. Net ecosystem production (NEP) for the 2006–2010 interval on forestland was predominantly positive (a carbon sink) throughout the region, with maximum values in the Coast Range, intermediate values in the Cascade Mountains, and relatively low values in the Inland Rocky Mountain ecoregions. Localized negative NEPs were mostly associated with recent disturbances. There was large interannual variation in regional NEP, with notably low values across the region in 2003, which was also the warmest year in the interval. The recent (2006–2010) net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was positive for the region (14.4 TgC year-1). Despite a lower area-weighted mean NECB, public forestland contributed a larger proportion to the total NECB because of its larger area.

We hence produce a global, annual emission field at 0.25° resolution. Our distribution of emissions is smoother than that of the population downscaling traditionally used to describe emissions. Comparison with the Vulcan inventory suggests that the assimilated product performs better than downscaling for distributions of either population or nightlights alone for describing the spatial structure of emissions over the United States. We describe the complex structure of uncertainty that arises from combining pointwise and area integrated constraints. Uncertainties can be as high as 50% at the pixel level and are not spatially independent. We describe the use of 14 CO2 measurements to further constrain national emissions.

It is demonstrated here that CO2 release in estuaries is largely supported by microbial decomposition of highly productive intertidal marsh biomass. It appears that riverine OC, however, would bypass the estuarine zone, because of short river - transit times, and contribute to carbon cycling in the ocean margins and interiors. Low-latitude ocean margins release CO2 because they receive two - thirds of the terrestrial OC. Because of recent CO2 increase in the atmosphere, CO2 releases from low latitudes have become weaker and CO2 uptake by mid - and high - latitude shelves has become stronger, thus leading to more dissolved inorganic carbon export to the ocean.","2011","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-12-07 17:43:42","","123-45","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21329201","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\53NC3IAU\Cai - 2011 - Estuarine and Coastal Ocean Carbon Paradox CO2 Si.pdf","","Carbon Cycle; Wetlands; Journal Article; Aquatic; Sea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

FCO2 was determined in the intertidal zone via eddy covariance; while in the near-shore using mooring buoy sensors then calculated with the bulk method. The near-shore region was a weak annual net source of CO2 to the atmosphere (0.043 mol CO2 m 2 y 1) ; where 91% of the outgassed FCO2 was contributed during the upwelling season. Sea surface temperature (SST) and DpCO2 (from upwelling) showed the strongest relationship with FCO2 in the near-shore, suggesting the importance of meso-scale processes (upwelling).

Wind speed showed the strongest relationship with FCO2 in the intertidal zone, suggesting the relevance of micro-scale processes. Results show that there are substantial spatial and temporal differences in FCO2 between the near-shore and intertidal zone; likely a result of heterogeneity.

In this work we use forest inventory data to parameterize a carbon cycle model to represent post-disturbance carbon trajectories of carbon pools and fluxes for specific forest types growing in high and low site productivity class settings. We then apply these trajectories to landscapes and regions based on forest age distributions derived from either the FIA data or from Landsat time series stacks (1985 - 2006) for 54 representative scenes throughout most of the conterminous United States. We estimate the net carbon uptake in forests caused by post-disturbance growth and decomposition (“regrowth sink”) for forested regions across the country. At the landscape scale, the prevailing condition of positive net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is in stark contrast to local patches with large sources, particularly in the west where fires and clear cuts create contiguous disturbed patches. At the continental scale, regional differences in disturbance rates reflect management patterns of high disturbance rates in the Southeastern and South Central states, and lower disturbance rates in the Northeast and Northern Lakes States. Despite low contemporary disturbance rates in the Northeast and Northern Lakes States (0.61 and 0.74% y-1), the regrowth sink there remains of moderate to large strength (88 and 57 g C m-2 y-1) owing to the continued legacy from historical clearing. Large regrowth sinks are also found in the Southeast, South Central, and Pacific Southwest regions (85, 86, and 95 g C m-2 y-1) where disturbance rates also tend to be higher (1.59, 1.38, and 0.93% y-1). Overall, the Landsat-derived disturbance rates are elevated relative to FIA-derived rates (1.19 versus 0.93% y-1) particularly for western regions. The differences only modestly adjust regional- and continental-scale carbon budgets, reducing NEP from forest regrowth by about 8%.","2014-08","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-03-03 18:14:50","","57-71","","","151","","Remote Sens Environ","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000342264000006","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\9TL6S3QY\Williams et al. - 2014 - Impacts of Disturbance History On Forest Carbon St.pdf","","Journal Article; Sequestration; Oregon; Growth; Disturbance; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Long-term solutions to climate change will require reduction in GHG emissions as well as the removal of large quantities of GHGs from the atmosphere. Natural climate solutions (NCS), i.e., changes in land management, ecosystem restoration, and avoided conversion of habitats, have substantial potential to meet global and national greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets and contribute to the global drawdown of GHGs. However, the relative role of NCS to contribute to GHG reduction at subnational scales is not well known. We examined the potential for 12 NCS activities on natural and working lands in Oregon, USA to reduce GHG emissions in the context of the state’s climate mitigation goals. We evaluated three alternative scenarios wherein NCS implementation increased across the applicable private or public land base, depending on the activity, and estimated the annual GHG reduction in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) attributable to NCS from 2020 to 2050. We found that NCS within Oregon could contribute annual GHG emission reductions of 2.7 to 8.3 MMT CO2e by 2035 and 2.9 to 9.8 MMT CO2e by 2050. Changes in forest-based activities including deferred timber harvest, riparian reforestation, and replanting after wildfires contributed most to potential GHG reductions (76 to 94% of the overall annual reductions), followed by changes to agricultural management through no-till, cover crops, and nitrogen management (3 to 15% of overall annual reductions). GHG reduction benefits are relatively high per unit area for avoided conversion of forests (125–400 MT CO2e ha-1). However, the existing land use policy in Oregon limits the current geographic extent of active conversion of natural lands and thus, avoided conversions results in modest overall potential GHG reduction benefits (i.e., less than 5% of the overall annual reductions). Tidal wetland restoration, which has high per unit area carbon sequestration benefits (8.8 MT CO2e ha-1 yr-1), also has limited possible geographic extent resulting in low potential (< 1%) of state-level GHG reduction contributions. However, cobenefits such as improved habitat and water quality delivered by restoration NCS pathways are substantial. Ultimately, reducing GHG emissions and increasing carbon sequestration to combat climate change will require actions across multiple sectors. We demonstrate that the adoption of alternative land management practices on working lands and avoided conversion and restoration of native habitats can achieve meaningful state-level GHG reductions.","2020-04-10","2020-04-27 18:35:25","2020-10-06 22:39:05","2020-04-27 18:35:25","e0230424","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\TKFXHX7Y\Graves et al. - 2020 - Potential greenhouse gas reductions from Natural C.pdf","","Biomass; Pools; Journal Article; Flux; Oregon","","Sihi, Debjani","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It serves as the U.S. Forest Service forest sector technical report for the National Climate Assessment and includes descriptions of key regional issues and examples of a risk-based framework for assessing climate-change effects.  By the end of the 21st century, forest ecosystems in the United States will differ from those of today as a result of changing climate. Although increases in temperature, changes in precipitation, higher atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), and higher nitrogen (N) deposition may change ecosystem structure and function, the most rapidly visible and most significant short-term effects on forest ecosystems will be caused by altered disturbance regimes. For example, wildfires, insect infestations, pulses of erosion and flooding, and drought-induced tree mortality are all expected to increase during the 21st century. These direct and indirect climate-change effects are likely to cause losses of ecosystem services in some areas, but may also improve and expand ecosystem services in others. Some areas may be particularly vulnerable because current infrastructure and resource production are based on past climate and steady-state conditions. The ability of communities with resource-based economies to adapt to climate change is linked to their direct exposure to these changes, as well as to the social and institutional structures present in each environment. Human communities that have diverse economies and are resilient to change today will also be prepared for future climatic stresses.  Significant progress has been made in developing scientific principles and tools for adapting to climate change through science-management partnerships focused on education, assessment of vulnerability of natural resources, and development of adaptation strategies and tactics. In addition, climate change has motivated increased use of bioenergy and carbon (C) sequestration policy options as mitigation strategies, emphasizing the effects of climate change-human interactions on forests, as well as the role of forests in mitigating climate change. Forest growth and afforestation in the United States currently account for a net gain in C storage and offset approximately 13 percent of the Nation’s fossil fuel CO2 production. Climate change mitigation through forest C management focuses on (1) land use change to increase forest area (afforestation) and avoid deforestation, (2) C management in existing forests, and (3) use of wood as biomass energy, in place of fossil fuel or in wood products for C storage and in place of other building materials.  Although climate change is an important issue for management and policy, the interaction of changes in biophysical environments (e.g., climate, disturbance, and invasive species) and human responses to those changes (management and policy) will ultimately determine outcomes for ecosystem services and people. Although uncertainty exists about the magnitude and timing of climate-change effects on forest ecosystems, sufficient scientific information is available to begin taking action now. Building on practices compatible with adapting to climate change provides a good starting point for land managers who may want to begin the adaptation process. Establishing a foundation for managing forest ecosystems in the context of climate change as soon as possible will ensure that a broad range of options will be available for managing forest resources sustainably.","2012","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-10 00:45:43","","265","","","","","","","","","","General Technical Report","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","","","Government publication","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\IAB5Z44H\Vose et al. - 2012 - Effects of Climatic Variability and Change on Fore.pdf","","Processes; GTR; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-870","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The combination of large, concentrated carbon fluxes and rapid change makes cities key elements of the carbon cycle and offers the potential for them to serve as “first responders” for climate action. Estimates of urban-scale carbon fluxes are significantly more uncertain than at larger spatial scales, in part because past studies have mostly avoided local/urban scales where the mix of anthropogenic and natural fluxes is complex and difficult to observationally isolate. To develop effective emission reduction policies, we need to understand emission sources and how they may be changing. Such improved quantification and understanding of underlying processes at the urban scale will not only provide policy-relevant information and improve the understanding of urban dynamics and future scenarios, but will also translate into better global-scale anthropogenic flux estimates, and advance our understanding of carbon cycle and climate feedbacks across multiple scales. Understanding the relationship between urbanization and urban carbon flows requires intellectual integration with research communities beyond the natural sciences. Cities can serve as interdisciplinary process laboratories that are sufficiently constrained in both spatial and governance scale to support truly integrated research by the natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering. A thoughtfully crafted science research agenda that is grounded in sustained, dense observations relevant to estimating urban carbon fluxes and their controlling processes and is focused on a statistically significant sample of cities will advance our understanding of the carbon cycle.","2014","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2020-10-07 16:27:08","","473-495","","10","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\HDGKJUED\Hutyra et al. - 2014 - Urbanization and the Carbon Cycle Current Capabil.pdf","","Carbon Cycle; Journal Article; Urban forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the factors controlling land C uptake is critical for reducing uncertainties in projections of future climate. The relative importance of changing climate, rising atmospheric CO2, and other factors, however, remains unclear despite decades of research. Here, we use an ensemble of land models to show that models disagree on the primary driver of cumulative C uptake for 85% of vegetated land area. Disagreement is largest in model sensitivity to rising atmospheric CO2 which shows almost twice the variability in cumulative land uptake since 1901 (1 s.d. of 212.8 PgC vs. 138.5 PgC, respectively). We find that variability in CO2 and temperature sensitivity is attributable, in part, to their compensatory effects on C uptake, whereby comparable estimates of C uptake can arise by invoking different sensitivities to key environmental conditions. Conversely, divergent estimates of C uptake can occur despite being based on the same environmental sensitivities. Together, these findings imply an important limitation to the predictability of C cycling and climate under unprecedented environmental conditions. We suggest that the carbon modeling community prioritize a probabilistic multi-model approach to generate more robust C cycle projections.","2017-07","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2020-10-07 16:27:08","","4765","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","28684755","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QTL4IGCJ\Huntzinger et al. - 2017 - Uncertainty in the response of terrestrial carbon .pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These rates of land-use change were used in a cohort model, together with equations defining the changes in live vegetation, slash, wood products and soil that follow a change in land use, to calculate the annual flux of carbon to the atmosphere from changes in land use. 2 The calculated flux increased from less than 10 TgC/yr in 1700 to a maximum of about 400 TgC/yr around 1880 and then decreased to approximately zero by 1950. The total flux for the 290-year period was a release of 32.6 PgC. The area of forests and woodlands declined by 42% (160x10^6 ha), releasing 29 PgC, or 90% of the total flux. Cultivation of soils accounted for about 25% of the carbon loss. Between 1950 and 1990 the annual flux of carbon was approximately zero, although eastern forests were accumulating carbon. 3 When the effects of fire and fire exclusion (reported in a companion paper) were added to this analysis of land-use change, the uptake of carbon calculated for forests was similar in magnitude to the uptake measured in forest inventories, suggesting that past harvests account for a significant fraction of the observed carbon sink in forests. 4 Changes in the management of croplands between 1965 and 1990 may have led to an additional accumulation of carbon, not included in the 32.6 PgC release, but even with this additional non-forest sink, the calculated accumulation of carbon in the United States was an order of magnitude smaller than the North American carbon sink inferred recently from atmospheric data and models.","2000","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2020-10-07 00:40:30","","125-144","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\VDJZQVFU\Houghton and Hackler - 2000 - Changes in Terrestrial Carbon Storage in the Unite.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the northern permafrost region experiences as much as a doubling of the rate of warming as the rest of the Earth, the vast amount of C in permafrost soils is vulnerable to thaw, decomposition and release as atmospheric greenhouse gases. Diagnostic and predictive estimates of highlatitude terrestrial C fluxes vary widely among different models depending on how dynamics in permafrost, and the seasonally thawed ‘active layer’ above it, are represented. Here, we employ a process based model simulation experiment to assess the net effect of active layer dynamics on this ‘permafrost carbon feedback’ in recent decades, from 1970 to 2006, over the circumpolar domain of continuous and discontinuous permafrost. Over this time period, the model estimates a mean increase of 6.8 cm in active layer thickness across the domain, which exposes a total of 11.6 Pg C of thawed SOM to decomposition. According to our simulation experiment, mobilization of this previously frozen C results in an estimated cumulative net source of 3.7 Pg C to the atmosphere since 1970 directly tied to active layer dynamics. Enhanced decomposition from the newly exposed SOM accounts for the release of both CO2 (4.0 Pg C) and CH4 (0.03 Pg C), but is partially compensated by CO2 uptake (0.3 Pg C) associated with enhanced net primary production of vegetation. This estimated net C transfer to the atmosphere from permafrost thaw represents a significant factor in the overall ecosystem carbon budget of the PanArctic, and a nontrivial additional contribution on top of the combined fossil fuel emissions from the eight Arctic nations over this time period.","2014","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-12-03 19:05:05","","045005","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\KUTSQ8VW\Hayes et al. - 2014 - The impacts of recent permafrost thaw on land–atmo.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Soil; Perfmafrost; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even when sequestration of carbon in wooden buildings is induded in the models, timber harvest results in a net flux of CO2 to the atmosphere. To offset this effect, the production oflumber and other long-term wood products, as well as the lifespan of buildings, would have to increase markedly.

The work will allow the model to calculate carbon fluxes from forest disturbances and postdisturbance recovery processes with unprecedented spatial and temporal details. Using NAFD disturbance maps and spectral trajectories from Landsat time-series stacks, forest areas can be separated into three broad age categories. “Young” forests had standclearing disturbance occurring with known year between 1985 and 2013. “Middle-aged” forests are areas recovering to forest include pixels that were not identified as forest (spectrally) in 1984 but became forested in later years, or forests that grew substantially over 30 years as indicated by trends in the 30-year Landsat surface reflectance record. “Old” forests include locations that remained forested between 1984 and 2014 and showed no obvious trend in the 30-year Landsat record. During this presentation, the three- tiered approach to model per pixel estimates of age and biomass using NAFD products and FIA plot data will be discussed along with results from prototype studies and updates to the bookkeeping model.","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-08 23:49:38","","139-139","","","","","","","","","","New Directions in Inventory Techniques & Applications Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) Symposium 2015","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\V6TC2GCY\Schleeweis et al. - 2015 - USING FIA AND LANDSAT OBSERVATIONS TO IMPROVE THE .pdf","","Biomass; GTR; FIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our cost estimates have five distinguishing features: (1) we estimate costs for each county in the contiguous United States; (2) we include afforestation of rangeland, in addition to cropland and pasture; (3) our opportunity cost estimates account for capitalized returns to future development (including associated option values) in addition to returns to agricultural production; (4) we develop a new set of forest establishment costs for each county; and (5) we incorporate data on Holdridge life zones to limit afforestation in locations where temperature and moisture availability prohibit forest growth. We find that at a carbon price of $50/ton, approximately 200 million tons of carbon would be sequestered annually through afforestation. At a price of $100/ton, an additional 100 million tons of carbon would be sequestered each year.

We determine whether a carbonneutral community is attained when these two factors are balanced.

We found total estimated anthropogenic emissions from Sitka to be in the range of 100,000 to 150,000 Mg carbon per year. Carbon sequestration by forests on Baranof Island was conservatively estimated to be more than 250,000 Mg carbon per year.

We use a combination of field plots, lidar, NAIP, and a NAIP-derived canopy surface DSM. Given that height drives many key inventory variables (e.g. height, volume, biomass, carbon), remote-sensing derived height information provides a powerful tool to make fine scale inference about height related forest attributes. Predictions can also be aggregated to sub-stand, stand, or strata levels. Remote-sensing derived forest attributes can also be used to automate stand delineation, a capability that we incorporated into our inventory system following object-oriented segmentation with eCognition software. Our sampling design is closely related to the FIA plot design (paneled hexagonal grid), with slight modifications to the plot and grid layouts to accommodate remote sensing auxiliary variables, and to provide greater flexibility in adapting to changes in funding for field measurements. Modifications include (e.g.) using 1/5 acre fixed plots, survey-grade plot positioning with Javad GNNS units, and providing extra panels in each hex grid cell.

The main objectives of this study were to assess regional biomass stores, examine the biomass partitioning between live and dead pools, and evaluate the effect of disturbance on live and dead biomass pools. Data collected by the Forest Inventory and Analysis program between 1995 and 2003 across all ownerships in Coastal Alaska were used to estimate live tree, snag, and log biomass pools in forest types, and ecoregions (Boreal versus Temperate). The regional average combined (live and dead) biomass was 76.7±3.8 Mg/ha in the Boreal ecoregion and 277.5±5.4 Mg/ ha in the Temperate ecoregion. Biomass of snags and logs comprising Coarse Woody Debris (CWD) pool was 35.1±3.1 Mg/ha in the Boreal ecoregion and 58.6±2.1 Mg/ha in the Temperate ecoregion. Total regional biomass was 45.4±3.0 Tg and 1001.9±20.6 Tg, whereas CWD biomass was 20.8±2.1 Tg and 211.4±7.7 Tg for the Boreal and the Temperate ecoregions, respectively. In the Boreal ecoregion, the recent spruce bark beetle outbreaks greatly increased CWD stores, with damaged stands containing 82% of total CWD biomass. Decomposition rate-constants for beetle-killed spruce in the Boreal ecoregion were 0.02 yr-1 (from chronosequence) and 0.04 yr-1 (from decomposition-vectors) for logs and 0.001 yr-1 for snags. The complexity of temporal pattern of C stores and fluxes was influenced by the form of mortality (snags vs. logs). In the Temperate ecoregion, undisturbed stands contained 76% of total CWD, indicating disturbance had less impact on CWD stores. In Coastal Alaska, average live biomass (194.0±4.1 Mg/ha) was 4-23 percent higher and average snag biomass (29.5±1.0 Mg/ ha) was approximately twice as high as that found in Washington and Oregon, states considered to have high biomass stores.","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 19:11:38","","198-198","","","","","","","","","","New Directions in Inventory Techniques & Applications Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) Symposium 2015","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\VA6GIUKD\Yatskov et al. - 2015 - REGIONAL BIOMASS STORES AND DYNAMICS IN FORESTS OF.pdf","","Biomass; Pools; Alaska; GTR; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent evidence has pointed to the importance of climate as a driver of belowground C stocks. This study describes an approach for adjusting allometric models of belowground C with climate-derived predictions of belowground C stocks and quantifies the change in reported belowground C stocks applied to the US National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGHGI). Climateadjusted predictions varied by region and forest type, but represented a 6.4% increase at the national scale when compared to current estimates. By combining allometric equations with trends in temperature, we conclude that climate variables can be used to adjust the US NGHGI estimates of belowground C stocks. Such strategies can also be used to determine the effects of future global change scenarios within a biomass and C accounting framework.","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-08 19:50:19","","120-123","","","","","","","","","","General Technical Report","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\JDWX63WI\Russell et al. - 2015 - INCORPORATING CLIMATE INTO BELOWGROUND CARBON ESTI.pdf","","Roots; GTR; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The flexible design of FCCS allows users to represent the structural complexity and diversity of fuels created through natural processes (e.g., forest succession and disturbance) and management activities (e.g., forest harvesting and fuels reduction). Each fuelbed is organized into six strata, including canopy, shrubs, herbaceous vegetation, woody fuels, litter-lichen-moss, and ground fuels. Strata are further divided into categories and subcategories. Fuelbeds representing common fuel types throughout much of North America are available in the FCCS reference library. Users may select an FCCS fuelbed to represent their specific project or customize a fuelbed to reflect actual site conditions. The FCCS reports the following results: (1) fuel characteristics by fuelbed, stratum, category, and subcategory; (2) surface fire behavior (i.e., reaction intensity, rate of spread, and flame length); and (3) FCCS fire potential ratings of surface fire behavior, crown fire behavior, and available fuels. With its large fuels data set and ability to represent a wide variety of fuel conditions, the FCCS has numerous applications, from small-scale fuel reduction projects to large-scale emissions and carbon assessments.

Soil, as a critical component of the forest carbon stocks, has been sampled in about 10-year intervals in FIA with the re-measurement underway. However, the magnitude of detectable change in soil organic carbon (SOC) with the current sampling scheme is unknown. We aim to identify SOC variability and to best determine minimum detectable changes in SOC under the current sampling scheme. The project seeks to: identify statistical relationships between SOC and environmental covariates; normalize SOC data for main forest-type groups (FTGs) using identified covariates; and determine the minimum detectable change in the normalized SOC using power analysis. We investigated SOC variability for 8 FTGs: Oak-Hickory, Maple-Beech-Birch, PinyonJuniper, Loblolly-Shortleaf Pine, Aspen-Birch, Douglas-Fir, Fir-Spruce-Mountain Hemlock and Woodland Hardwoods. Relationships between SOC and environmental covariates (biomass/soil properties in FIA, PRISM climate data, and DEM-derived terrain attributes) are determined by multiple linear regression and are used to normalize SOC variability. The results showed that terrain attributes were not significant in explaining SOC in the FIA dataset and climate data were only significant in certain FTGs locations. Except for Oak-Hickory, Maple-Beech-Birch and Pinyon-Juniper groups, sample numbers are insufficient to detect a change in SOC less than 10 percent (%) of the mean. To guide future sampling efforts, we will continue our study on detecting minimal change in SOC and to explore sample number and sampling frequency scenarios to inform future soil sampling protocols.","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-14 15:55:12","","159-162","","","","","","","","","","New Directions in Inventory Techniques & Applications Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) Symposium 2015","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\UCWLVE4Q\Wu et al. - 2015 - CHANGE DETECTION FOR SOIL CARBON IN THE FOREST INV.pdf","","GTR; Soil; FIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the regulatory tools being considered is a cap and trade system, whereby a ceiling is set for allowable carbon dioxide emissions and emitters are allowed to purchase offsets if they exceed their allowable emissions. Forests are major carbon sinks, and reforestation or projects to avoid deforestation are considered an offset with a monetary value under a majority of cap and trade systems.

In boreal forests, moss and lichen mats often serve as the interface between soils and the atmosphere, therefore characterizing the biomass and composition of mats is essential for understanding how forest carbon exchange might interact with shifting climatic regimes. Previous estimation approaches did not permit volumetric estimates of moss mats and were based on inconsistent definitions distinguishing between soil, duff, and moss layers. We confronted these challenges by implementing a novel, non-destructive technique centered on three research questions. First, what is the pattern of biomass and carbon distribution for moss/lichen ground layers in subarctic, interior Alaska? Second, how do climatic and stand-level factors drive these patterns? Third, what are the functional consequences and ecosystem effects of moss/ lichen ground layers? Moss and lichen species were assigned to functional groups based on the capacity to fix nitrogen, serve as wildlife forage, indicate disturbance, alter hydrology, or signal eutrophic conditions (among other ecosystem functions). Among 99 sites located in the Tanana River valley of interior Alaska, biomass averaged 12 934 kg ha-1 (SD: 8546), of which carbon was an estimated 5456 (3778) kg ha-1. Biomass had a weakly negative relationship with plant litter depth, to which topoedaphic and climatic factors also contributed. On average there were 7.2 functional groups per site – most frequent and abundant were nitrogen-fixing mosses, which commonly formed extensive, thick carpets. Together, these findings imply that moss and lichen mats in the Tanana River area can contribute substantially to both forest nitrogen stores and organic carbon sequestration.","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-09 18:39:07","","55-55","","","","","","","","","","New Directions in Inventory Techniques & Applications Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) Symposium 2015","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\KH43MQAV\Smith et al. - 2015 - EVALUATING CARBON STORES AT THE EARTH-ATMOSPHERE I.pdf","","Pools; Alaska; GTR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The resulting response curves can also be used to develop estimates of potential carbon response under alternative management or disturbance scenarios.","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 22:27:24","","141-146","","","","","","","","","","New Directions in Inventory Techniques & Applications Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) Symposium 2015","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ICNIEKTS\McCarter and Healey - 2015 - DEVELOPMENT OF CARBON RESPONSE TRAJECTORIES USING .pdf","","Modeling; GTR; Growth; FIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these benefits have not been well quantified, making it difficult for urban planners and property owners to weigh their costs and benefits or assess tree cover against competing land uses. New research from the Pacific Northwest (PNW) Research Station demonstrates that street trees increase home prices in Portland, Oregon, that shade trees reduce household energy use in Sacramento, California, and that these effects can be measured and expressed in dollars. A study led by economist Geoffrey Donovan, research forester with the PNW Research Station, determined that trees planted on the south and west sides of Sacramento houses reduced summertime electricity bills by an average of $25.16. In a second study in Portland, Donovan’s team found that street trees growing in front of or near a house added an average $8,870 to its sale price and reduced its time on the market by nearly 2 days.

However, as trees are storing carbon, water is leaching it from the soil. Some of the carbon is captured by microbial communities living in the stream’s hyporheic zone, a region within the streambed, where it is turned back into CO2. Gas exchanges between water and air release this CO2 back into the atmosphere. These carbon fluxes previously have not been well quantified, which could affect carbon budgets developed for national forests. Researchers with the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station and Oregon State University analyzed 10 years of data from a headwater stream located in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in western Oregon to calculate the watershed’s annual carbon budget. They measured the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, and particulate organic carbon in the stream and hyporheic zone and estimated the CO2 flux from the stream surface.

Using today’s terminology, some of these purposes are considered ecosystem services, which encompass a breadth of benefits provided by forests, including their ability to absorb and store atmospheric carbon, a greenhouse gas linked to climate change. National forests are now working to mitigate climate change, but the tradeoffs involved in managing for multiple ecosystem services are not well understood. Using landscape-scale datasets of forest vegetation, carbon storage estimates, and wildlife habitat profiles, scientists with the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station simulated the effects of various management plans on timber harvests, wildlife habitat, and carbon storage in forests of the western Cascade Range. They found that ecosystem services may be complementary, competitive, or neutral (e.g., a change in one service has little effect on other services). For example, carbon sequestration is potentially competitive with timber harvests and creating wildlife habitat for the western bluebird, but can be complementary to maintaining habitat for the northern spotted owl and the red tree vole. By using this tradeoff management framework, land managers will have a better understanding of the multiple ecosystem services a management plan may provide.","2017-11","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-10 01:23:55","","6","","","","","","","","","","Science Findings","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\BKTNXX7G\Watts - 2017 - Can We Store Carbon and Have Our Timber and Habita.pdf","","Pools; Wood products; Science Findings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","202","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forests store vast amounts of carbon, but it’s not fully understood how a forest’s storage capacity fluctuates as stands age or respond to disturbance. To calculate the carbon flux in the forests of Oregon and Washington, scientists with the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station compiled field measurements and quantified the amount of carbon accumulated or released in relation to a forest’s age, disturbance history, and species of trees. The scientists found that forested lands store carbon at a rate of 7 million metric tons per year. Although older forest stands and individual large trees store more carbon than younger trees, younger forests and small trees accumulate carbon at a faster rate per acre.

These factors make forest conservation and management important components of most strategies for adapting to and lessening the impacts of climate change. Developing these strategies is complicated by the constant interplay between forest ecosystems and climate, which impacts the costs and effectiveness of mitigation. Researchers at the PNW Station have developed novel methods for integrating the complex relationships between human decisions, forest ecosystems, and the climate system. Their work shows that there is substantial room for increased carbon storage on public and private forest land. Sequestering large amounts of forest carbon, however, could require significant funding for incentives to induce private owners to conserve forests, which during the 1990s were converted to developed uses at a rate of more than 1 million acres per year.

To quantify the range of the possible effects of climate change over the next century, researchers used state-of-the-art climate change simulations coupled with a dynamic vegetation model to gauge sensi¬tivity of natural ecosystems in California under several climate scenarios.  The results suggest that climate change would have a more pervasive impact on the vegetation community diversity than would urbanization. Vegetation is estimated to migrate to higher elevations, which would result in reductions in the area covered by alpine meadows and subalpine forests. The area of commercially-important softwood tree species and the state’s signature wood¬lands and shrublands are predicted to decline with warming.  Climate change could also affect fire frequency and the area burned annually, with most of the scenarios resulting in increased fire.

In recent decades, however, it has become evident that people also value many other benefits offered by the natural world, such as support for indigenous cultures and sustainable communities, protection for endangered species, and carbon sequestration. The “ecosystem services” concept has emerged as a way to describe a much broader suite of goods and services, including those that are more difficult to quantify than the traditionally recognized major uses. The 2012 Forest Service planning rule requires that ecosystem services be addressed in assessment and planning.

They take issue with the measurement systems used to determine trading parameters and find validity in the concerns that many market experts have expressed about additionality and leakage. Energy benefits typically are ignored in forest carbon offset projects, which promotes misunderstandings about overall atmospheric carbon flux. The authors emphasize the carbon-storage benefits of using wood products in place of nonrenewable, energy-intensive materials and using woodbased energy instead of fossil fuels.

Prioritizing treatment areas and determining the most effective techniques for fuel hazard reduction depends on various factors such as owner objectives, forest types, and the availability of processing facilities. Scientists from the Pacific Northwest Research Station created an analytic system that allows forest managers to simultaneously assess fuel hazard treatment effectiveness, the location and capacity of processing facilities, and financial feasibility. The analysis framework uses the nationwide Forest Inventory and Analysis database, which enables foresters and analysts to use it as a tool to inform decision making. Researchers applied numerous policy scenarios to a 28-million-acre, four-ecosystem region of Oregon and northern California.

Jeff Kline and Trista Patterson, scientists with the Pacific Northwest (PNW) Research Station, have identified several criteria needed for ecosystem service markets to achieve their potential. These include regulatory limits on environmental damage, ecosystem services that are amenable to trading, and manageable transaction costs related to administering market programs and the necessary measuring and monitoring of marketed resources. If these criteria are not met, other conservation methods such as conservation easements, landowner incentive programs for environmental enhancement or protection, or taxes on environmental damage may be more effective. Discussions about ecosystem services often focus on increasing supply - storing more carbon or delivering more water, for example. However, net pressures on ecosystems can also be reduced by addressing consumption. Many energy efficiencies can be achieved by promoting awareness, informed choices, and behavior change.

By keeping forests as forests, land use planning capitalizes on the natural landscape’s ability to sequester atmospheric carbon, a key contributor to climate change. Nationwide, however, forest land is the land type most frequently converted to more developed uses. When this happens, carbon storage opportunities are lost, and the new use, such as a housing development, often becomes a net carbon producer. Scientists from the Pacific Northwest Research Station and Oregon Department of Forestry quantified the carbon storage maintained by the land use planning program in western Oregon. They found these gains were equivalent to avoiding 1.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually - the amount of carbon that would have been emitted by 395,000 cars in a year. Had the 1.7 million metric tons of stored carbon been released through development, Oregon’s annual increase in CO2 emissions between 1990 and 2000 would have been three times what it actually was.

They found that keeping logging debris in place improved soil fertility, especially in areas with coarse-textured, nutrient-poor soils. Soil nitrogen and other nutrients important to tree growth increased, and soil water availability increased due to the debris’ mulching effect. The debris cooled the soil, which slowed the breakdown and release of soil carbon into the atmosphere.

"3Q2N62F9","report","2003","Duncan, Sally","Biology, Ecology, and Economics at Play: Land Use and Land Cover Changes in the 21st Century","","","","","","In making choices about how to manage the country’s wealth of forest land, stakeholders - including U.S. taxpayers - have many choices, all of them with ripple effects that extend far beyond the immediate stands of trees. In the Pacific Northwest, as elsewhere, biophysical, ecological, and socioeconomic factors combine to influence the areas of forest cover types and their fragmentation. How do we take all these factors into account as we make sustainable natural resource management decisions? Past studies have tended to view only subsets of the whole set of factors and also have tended to examine changes in land use at relatively small scales. Outcomes over large geographic areas, including privately owned land, have not been closely monitored. Clearly, large-scale and interrelated studies are needed to address net changes in forest cover types that result from natural and human-caused forces. The Resources Planning Act’s 2000 assessment provides this type of large-scale, cross-sectoral study; scientists from the Pacific Northwest Research Station contributed to the findings about land use changes and their complex interactions across the country. The renewable resource assessments analyze present and anticipated uses of, demand for, and supply of the renewable resources, with consideration of the international resource situation and an emphasis of pertinent supply, demand, and price relationship trends. Land managers and policy analysts can now use the information from the historical analysis and associated projections of forest cover changes in planning for wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration to address global climate change, timber supply, and other goods and services from our forests.","2003-08","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-11-30 18:10:07","","6","","","","","","","","","","Science Findings","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\4HRNBDQV\Duncan - 2003 - Biology, Ecology, and Economics at Play Land Use .pdf","","Economics; Policy; Science Findings; Land use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet basic information about the distribution and characteristics of snags and down trees in forests of the Pacific Northwest is lacking. Such information is needed to assess wildlife habitat, carbon stores, fuel conditions, and site productivity. Current guidelines for dead wood management are based on limited or dated scientific data. A recent study by the Pacific Northwest Research Station delved into existing resource inventories to create new information estimating density, volume, and percentage cover for dead wood across about 49 million acres of upland forests in Oregon and Washington. To estimate the natural range of variability in snags and down wood in upland forest habitats, researchers also analyzed plots containing no evidence of harvest activity. The findings are being used in deadwood management models and to provide information about wildlife habitat and ecosystem health. Another study assesses the amount of biomass and carbon stored in dead wood, providing information on carbon dynamics for global climate change and criteria and indicators specified in the Montreal Process. The Montreal Process is an initiative started in 1993 to develop a way to measure the outcomes of forest management.","2002-03","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-11-30 18:09:57","","6","","","","","","","","","","Science Findings","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\3WNMS7X5\Duncan - 2002 - DEAD WOOD ALL AROUND US THINK REGIONALLY TO MANAG.pdf","","Science Findings; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"9GDUU3H9","report","2008","Mazza, Rhonda","Changing With the Climate","","","","","","Carbon is a naturally occurring element, essential to life on this planet. We exhale it, while plants absorb it as part of the photosynthetic process. Human activities have altered the carbon balance, however, and as a result have triggered changes in climates around the world. By extracting and burning oil, coal, and natural gas, carbon that was locked in “longterm” storage underground has been released into the atmosphere. The associated greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide trap heat that would otherwise radiate back into space. Changes to the global climate have significant repercussions and will affect nearly all the Earth’s species in some way. A large source of uncertainty lies in the social changes that may or may not occur. As we grapple with what these changes mean for ecosystems, and how the output of critical services provided by these ecosystems will be affected, two broad-based strategies are at our disposal: adaptation and mitigation. Adaptation strategies aim to prepare the landscape and its habitants for the new climate, whereas mitigation strategies attempt to slow down the process of climate change. This issue of Science Update highlights research by scientists from the Pacific Northwest and Pacific Southwest Research Stations that addresses climate change in this context.","2008","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-09 16:46:51","","12","","","","","","","","","","Science Update","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\4UFPWGBK\Mazza - 2008 - Changing With the Climate.pdf","","Science Update; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined the influence of varying amounts of logging-debris retention (0, 40, and 80% coverage) and vegetation control (initial or annual applications) on in situ bulk soil respiration, microbial respiration, and total soil C at two Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] sites. Annual vegetation control decreased bulk respiration, which was attributed to reduced root respiration and OM inputs when competing vegetation was absent. There was no difference in potential microbial respiration or total soil C pools between vegetation-control treatments, indicating that OM inputs from competing vegetation were rapidly consumed in situ. Logging-debris retention reduced bulk respiration, microbial respiration, and soil temperature, but the significance and magnitude of the difference were variable. A soil temperature function explained between 44 and 76% of the variation in microbial and bulk respiration, but there was no effect of reduced temperature on microbial respiration with 40% coverage. Total soil C at the end of the experiment was higher with 80% coverage at the site with relatively low initial total soil C, but there was also a significant increase in total soil C at both sites when the logging debris was removed. The results suggest that root decomposition following harvesting causes an increase in total soil C, which is dependent on the magnitude of logging-debris retention, its influence on the soil environment, and ultimately the microbial response.","2010","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 19:44:41","2019-05-13 23:11:29","936","","3","74","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\IDF44L8L\Slesak et al. - 2010 - Soil Respiration and Carbon Responses to Logging D.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Soil; Silviculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Uncertainties regarding the fate of SOC are greater in high-latitude systems where data are sparse and the soils are affected by sub-zero temperatures. To address these issues in Alaska, a first-order assessment of data gaps and spatial distributions of SOC was conducted from a recently compiled soil carbon database. Temperature and landform type were the dominant controls on SOC distribution for selected ecoregions. Mean SOC pools (to a depth of 1-m) varied by three, seven and ten-fold across ecoregion, landform, and ecosystem types, respectively. Climate interactions with landform type and SOC were greatest in the uplands. For upland SOC there was a six-fold non-linear increase in SOC with latitude (i.e., temperature) where SOC was lowest in the Intermontane Boreal compared to the Arctic Tundra and Coastal Rainforest. Additionally, in upland systems mineral SOC pools decreased as climate became more continental, suggesting that the lower productivity, higher decomposition rates and fire activity, common in continental climates, interacted to reduce mineral SOC. For lowland systems, in contrast, these interactions and their impacts on SOC were muted or absent making SOC in these environments more comparable across latitudes. Thus, the magnitudes of SOC change across temperature gradients were non-uniform and depended on landform type. Additional factors that appeared to be related to SOC distribution within ecoregions included stand age, aspect, and permafrost presence or absence in black spruce stands. Overall, these results indicate the influence of major interactions between temperature-controlled decomposition and topography on SOC in high-latitude systems. However. there remains a need for more SOC data from wetlands and boreal-region permafrost soils, especially at depths> 1 m in order to fully understand the effects of climate on soil carbon in Alaska.","2011-11","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 17:16:32","2019-05-13 23:11:17","71-84","","","167-168","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\LYIDVJPE\Johnson et al. - 2011 - Soil carbon distribution in Alaska in relation to .pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Alaska; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The percent BDOC ranged from 7 to 38% across all sites, and was significantly greater in soil compared to stream water in the bog and forested wetland, but not in the upland forest. The percent BDOC also varied significantly over the entire sampling period in soil and stream water for the bog and forested wetland, as BDOC peaked during the spring runoff and was lowest during the summer months. Moreover, the chemical quality of DOM in wetland soil and stream water was similar during the spring runoff and fall wet season, as demonstrated by the similar contribution of protein-like fluorescence (sum of tyrosine and tryptophan fluorescence) in soil water and in streams, These findings suggest that the tight coupling between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is responsible for the delivery of labile DOM from wetland soils to streams. The contribution of protein-like fluorescence was significantly correlated with BDOC (p < 0.001) over the entire sampling period indicating DOM is an important source of C and N for heterotrophic microbes.

The combustion of fuels containing large downed wood can result in intense soil heating, alteration of soil properties, and mortality of microbes. Previous studies show ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) improve ponderosa seedling establishment after ﬁre but did not compare EMF communities at different levels of soil burn intensity in a ﬁeld setting. For this study, soil burn intensity effects on nutrients and EMF communities were compared at Pringle Falls Experimental Forest, La Pine, Oregon. Twelve replicate sites were used, each with three treatments: high intensity soil burn from large downed wood combustion (HB), low intensity soil burn (LB), and unburned control (UB). Temperatures lethal to fungi were detected at 0-cm, 5-cm, and 10-cm depths in HB soils and 0-cm depth in LB soils. Ponderosa pine seedlings planted post-burn were harvested after four months for EMF root tip analysis. We found: (a) greater differences in soil properties and nutrients in HB soils compared to LB and UB soils; (b) no differences in EMF richness and diversity among treatments; (c) weak differences in community composition based on relative abundance between UB and either burn treatments; and (d) EMF composition in HB and LB treatments correlated with soil carbon and organic matter contents. These results support the hypothesis that the combustion of large downed wood can alter the soil environment directly beneath it. However, an EMF community similar to LB soils recolonized HB soils within one growing season. Community results from both burn treatments suggest an increase in patchy spatial distribution of EMF. We hypothesize that quick initiation of EMF recolonization is possible depending on the size of high intensity burn patches, proximity of low and unburned soil, and survival of nearby hosts. The importance of incorporating mixed ﬁre effects in fuel management practices will help to provide EMF refugia for ponderosa pine forest regeneration.","2016-10","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-05 19:06:39","2019-05-13 23:10:24","160-172","","","378","","","Recovering lost ground","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\6DSI24BN\Cowan et al. - 2016 - Recovering lost ground Effects of soil burn inten.pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How climate change influences the severity of biomass burning has proved difficult to assess. Here, we examined the depth of ground-layer combustion in 178 sites dominated by black spruce in Alaska, using data collected from 31 fire events between 1983 and 2005. We show that the depth of burning increased as the fire season progressed when the annual area burned was small. However, deep burning occurred throughout the fire season when the annual area burned was large. Depth of burning increased late in the fire season in upland forests, but not in peatland and permafrost sites. Simulations of wildfire-induced carbon losses from Alaskan black spruce stands over the past 60 years suggest that ground-layer combustion has accelerated regional carbon losses over the past decade, owing to increases in burn area and late-season burning. As a result, soils in these black spruce stands have become a net source of carbon to the atmosphere, with carbon emissions far exceeding decadal uptake.","2011-01","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 17:37:44","2019-05-13 23:10:16","27-31","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\B2MMNGFF\Turetsky et al. - 2011 - Recent acceleration of biomass burning and carbon .pdf","","Fire; Biomass; Journal Article; Alaska; Flux; Soil; Live vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Biomass treatments included whole-tree (Wf) and bole-only (BO) harvest, and competing vegetation control (VC) treatments were applied as either initial or annual herbicide applications. There were main effects of biomass removal and VC on the absolute change in soil pools of some elements at both sites. but significant effects were more prevalent at the lower soil quality Matlock site than the Molalla site, and were generally confined to the top 15 em of soil. In all cases, treatment effects were associated with increases in C and nutrients following BO and initial VC treatments combined with little change in soil pools following wr and annual VC treatments. At the Matlock site, total soil pools (0-60 em) of C, N, and Ca significantly increased in the BO and initial VC treatments. and Mg increased and K decreased regardless of treatment. At the Molalla site, soil C and nutrient pools did not change in response to treatments, but total soil Mg increased in all treatments during the study period. Correlation analyses indicated little influence of soil nutrient pools on early growth at Matlock likely because soil water is more limiting than nutrient availability at that site, but vegetation growth was correlated to nutrient pools at Molalla indicating changes in pools associated with harvesting and treatment could influence crop development in the future. These early results indicate low potential for intensive management practices to reduce mineral soil pools of C and nutrients, but there is uncertainty on the long-term growth response because treatments may have influenced nutrient storage in pools other than mineral soil.","2011-11","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 19:45:09","2019-05-13 23:11:14","1722-1728","","9","262","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\5B2KM73W\Slesak et al. - 2011 - Soil carbon and nutrient pools in Douglas-fir plan.pdf","","Management; Biomass; Journal Article; Processes; Soil; Silviculture; Live vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The project was launched because there is considerable concern and increased awareness both within the international scientific community and the general public about the effects of global warming on the very large soil organic-matter pool in permafrost regions (Figure 1). A new estimate (Schuur et al., 2008; Tarnocai et al., 2009) indicates that the total below-ground carbon pool in permafrost regions (ca. 1672 PgC) is more than double the present atmospheric pool (ca. 730 PgC) and more than three times larger than the total global forest biomass (ca. 450 PgC). Permafrost degradation has already been observed in parts of the northern circumpolar region and a significant portion of permafrost is expected to thaw this century (ACIA, 2004). This could result in the release of greenhouse gases (both carbon dioxide and the much more potent methane) from soil organic matter decomposition. This positive feedback within the Earth System has not yet been considered in climate model projections of future global warming. A unique aspect of permafrost degradation is that gradual thawing of the ground with depth over time will be accompanied by more dramatic events, such as ground subsidence due to melting of buried ice bodies and lateral erosion along the edges of thaw lakes and arctic coastlines (Figure 2), further accelerating the release of greenhouse gases.","2009-04","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-03 19:17:22","2019-05-13 23:10:37","229-234","","2","20","","","Report from the International Permafrost Association","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QCPKRLC8\Kuhry et al. - 2009 - Report from the International Permafrost Associati.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Soil; Perfmafrost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, anthropogenic disturbances, such as forest conversion and wood harvest, strongly affect forest carbon dynamics within North America. This paper summarizes recent (2000 - 2008) rates of extraction, including both conversion and harvest, derived from national forest inventories for North America (the United States, Canada, and Mexico). During the 2000s, 6.1 million ha/yr were affected by harvest, another 1.0 million ha/yr were converted to other land uses through gross deforestation, and 0.4 million ha/yr were degraded. Thus about 1.0% of North America’s forests experienced some form of anthropogenic disturbance each year. However, due to harvest recovery, afforestation, and reforestation, the total forest area on the continent has been roughly stable during the decade. On average, about 110 m3 of roundwood volume was extracted per hectare harvested across the continent. Patterns of extraction vary among the three countries, with U.S. and Canadian activity dominated by partial and clear cut harvest, respectively, and activity in Mexico dominated by conversion (deforestation) for agriculture. Temporal trends in harvest and clearing may be affected by economic variables, technology, and forest policy decisions. While overall rates of extraction appear fairly stable in all three countries since the 1980s, harvest within the United States has shifted toward the southern United States and away from the Pacific Northwest.","2011-04-15","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 19:42:44","2019-05-13 23:10:20","22","","","116","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\DNUMLLCM\Masek et al. - 2011 - Recent rates of forest harvest and conversion in N.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Flux; Harvest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Forest and Agriculture Sector Optimization Model–Greenhouse Gases model is used to examine responses between sectors as part of the regional afforestation policy analysis. Main ﬁndings suggest that most of afforested area in the Midwest regions remains unharvested by mid-21th century but a signiﬁcant percentage of afforested area in the Southern regions shifts back to agricultural uses by this time. We also simulated a policy where carbon sequestration credits paid for afforestation are reduced 40% relative to other mitigation actions. A permanence value reduction for afforestation further promotes the harvesting of afforested stands in the Southern regions. Also, it has an impact not only on grassland pasture but also on high productive cropland. Results of this analysis are robust to lower permanence value reduction rates for higher carbon prices and can serve as upper bound of impacts for lower carbon prices.","2014-04","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 19:54:44","2019-05-13 23:09:52","12-21","","","41","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QJV9DGYD\Haim et al. - 2014 - Permanence of agricultural afforestation for carbo.pdf","","Journal Article; Growth; Economics; Policy; Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few studies have quantified impacts on carbon (C) cycling. In this study, we quantified the immediate response and subsequent trajectories of stand-level aboveground tree C stocks and fluxes using field measurements and modeling for a location in central Idaho, USA that experienced an outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins). We measured tree characteristics in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) plots spanning a range of structure and mortality conditions. We then initialized the forest vegetation simulator, an individual tree-based model, with these measure­ ments and simulated the response of aboveground production of C fluxes as well as trajectories of C stocks and fluxes in the coming decades. Mountain pine beetles killed up to 52% of the trees within plots, with more larger trees killed. C stocks in lodgepole pine were reduced by 31-83% following the outbreak, and plot-level C fluxes decreased 28-73%. Modeled C stocks increased nearly continuously following the infestation, recovering to preoutbreak levels in 25 years or less. Simulated aboveground tree C fluxes increased following the immediate postoutbreak decrease, then subsequently declined. Substantial variability of C stocks and fluxes among plots resulted from the number and size of killed and surviving trees. Our study illustrates that bark beetle epidemics alter forest C cycling unlike stand- . replacement wildfires or clear-cut harvests, due in part to incomplete mortality coupled with the preference by beetles for larger trees. The dependency of postoutbreak C stocks and fluxes on stand structure suggests that C budget models and studies in areas experiencing mountain pine beetle disturbances need to include size distribution of trees for the most accurate results.","2011-01","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-08 15:32:18","2019-05-13 23:09:38","339-350","","1","17","","","Observations and modeling of aboveground tree carbon stocks and fluxes following a bark beetle outbreak in the western United States","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\4UCW8MLH\Pfeifer et al. - 2011 - Observations and modeling of aboveground tree carb.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Flux; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, little is known about the microbiology or chemistry of permafrost soils that may affect its decomposition once soils thaw. We tested the hypothesis that low microbial abundances and activities in permafrost soils limit decomposition rates compared with active layer soils. We examined active layer and permafrost soils near Fairbanks, AK, the Yukon River, and the Arctic Circle. Soils were incubated in the lab under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Gas fluxes at -5 and 5°C were measured to calculate temperature response quotients (Ql0). The Ql0 was lower in permafrost soils (average 2.7) compared with active layer soils (average 7.5). Soil nutrients, leachable dissolved organic C (DOC) quality and quantity, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the soils revealed that the organic matter within permafrost soils is as labile, or even more so, than surface soils. Microbial abundances (fungi, bacteria, and subgroups: methanogens and Basidiomycetes) and exoenzyme activities involved in decomposition were lower in permafrost soils compared with active layer soils, which, together with the chemical data, supports the reduced Ql0 values. CH4 fluxes were correlated with methanogen abundance and the highest CH4 production came from active layer soils. These results suggest that permafrost soils have high inherent decomposability, but low microbial abundances and activities reduce the temperature sensitivity of C fluxes. Despite these inherent limitations, however, respiration per unit soil C was higher in permafrost soils compared with active layer soils, suggesting that decomposition and heterotrophic respiration may contribute to a positive feedback to warming of this eco region.","2010-02","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-10 00:52:22","2019-05-13 23:08:54","2543-2554","","9","16","","","Molecular investigations into a globally important carbon pool","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8WESBUIE\Waldrop et al. - 2010 - Molecular investigations into a globally important.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Alaska; Soil; Perfmafrost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, two versions of the terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycle components of the Integrated Science Assessment Model (ISAM) are used to evaluate how variation in nitrogen availability influences terrestrial carbon sinks and sources in response to changes over the 20th century in global environmental factors including atmospheric CO2 concentration, nitrogen inputs, temperature, precipitation and land use. The two versions of ISAM vary in their treatment of nitrogen availability: ISAM-NC has a terrestrial carbon cycle model coupled to a fully dynamic nitrogen cycle while ISAM-C has an identical carbon cycle model but nitrogen availability is always in sufficient supply. Overall, the two versions of the model estimate approximately the same amount of global mean carbon uptake over the 20th century. However, comparisons of results of ISAM-NC relative to ISAM-C reveal that nitrogen dynamics: (1) reduced the 1990s carbon sink associated with increasing atmospheric CO2 by 0.53 PgC yr-l (1 Pg = 1015g),(2) reduced the 1990s carbon source associated with changes in temperature and precipitation of 0.34 PgC yr-l in the 1990s, (3) an enhanced sink associated with nitrogen inputs by 0.26 PgC yr-1, and (4) enhanced the 1990s carbon source associated with changes in land use by 0.08 PgC yr-1 in the 1990s. These effects of nitrogen limitation influenced the spatial distribution of the estimated exchange of CO2 with greater sink activity in high latitudes associated with climate effects and a smaller sink of CO2 in the southeastern United States caused by N limitation associated with both CO2 fertilization and forest regrowth.

Across a replicated 200+ year old vegetation chronosequence, we tested the hypotheses that green alder has strong effects on soil chemical properties, and that ecosystem-level N inputs via N2 fixation decrease with secondary successional stand development. Across early-, mid-, and late-successional stands, alder created islands of elevated soil N and carbon (C), depleted soil phosphorus (P), and more acidic soils. These effects translated to the stand-level in response to alder stem density. Although neither N2 fixation nor nodule biomass differed among stand types, increases in alder densities with successional time translated to increasing N inputs. Estimates of annual N inputs by A. viridis averaged across the upland chronosequence (6.6 ± l.2 kg N ha-1 year-1) are substantially less than inputs during early succession by Alnus tenuifolia growing along Alaskan floodplains. However, late succession upland forests, where densities of A. viridis are highest, may persist for centuries, depending on fire return interval.

While these agents of forest change frequently overlap, uncertainty remains regarding their interactions and inﬂuence on speciﬁc subsequent ﬁre effects such as change in canopy cover. Acquisition of pre- and post-ﬁre Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data on the 2012 Pole Creek Fire in central Oregon provided an opportunity to isolate and quantify ﬁre effects coincident with speciﬁc agents of change. This study characterizes the inﬂuence of pre-ﬁre mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) and timber harvest disturbances on LiDAR-estimated change in canopy cover. Observed canopy loss from ﬁre was greater (higher severity) in areas experiencing pre-ﬁre MPB (D 18.8%CC) than ﬁre-only (D 11.1%CC). Additionally, increasing MPB intensity was directly related to greater canopy loss. Canopy loss was lower for all areas of pre-ﬁre timber harvest (D 3.9%CC) than for ﬁre-only, but among harvested areas, the greatest change was observed in the oldest treatments and the most intensive treatments [i.e., stand clearcut (D 5.0%CC) and combination of shelterwood establishment cuts and shelterwood removal cuts (D 7.7%CC)]. These results highlight the importance of accounting for and understanding the impact of pre-ﬁre agents of change such as MPB and timber harvest on subsequent ﬁre effects in land management planning.

However, these regions have recently experienced remarkable modification of the major driving forces of the carbon cycle, including surface air temperature warming that is significantly greater than the global average and associated increases in the frequency and severity of disturbances. Whether Arctic tundra and boreal forest ecosystems will continue to sequester atmospheric C02 in the face of these dramatic changes is unknown. Here we show the results of model simulations that estimate a 41 Tg C yr-1 sink in the boreal land regions from 1997 to 2006, which represents a 73% reduction in the strength of the sink estimated for previous decades in the late 20th century. Our results suggest that C02 uptake by the region in previous decades may not be as strong as previously estimated. The recent decline in sink strength is the combined result of (1) weakening sinks due to warming-induced increases in soil organic matter decomposition and (2) strengthening sources from pyrogenic C02 emissions as a result of the substantial area of boreal forest burned in wildfires across the region in recent years. Such changes create positive feedbacks to the climate system that accelerate global warming, putting further pressure on emission reductions to achieve atmospheric stabilization targets","2011-09","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-06 23:58:21","2019-05-13 23:07:30","14","","3","25","","","Is the northern high-latitude land-based CO <sub>2</sub> sink weakening?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\28YLBSZF\Hayes et al. - 2011 - Is the northern high-latitude land-based CO 2.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Flux; Boreal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Soil surface ﬂux is often lagged from soil temperature by several hours, which results in semielliptical hysteresis loops when surface ﬂux is plotted as a function of soil temperature. Both biological and physical explanations have been suggested for hysteresis patterns, and there is currently no consensus on their causes or how such data should be analyzed to interpret the sensitivity of respiration to temperature. We used a one-dimensional soil CO2 and heat transport model based on physical ﬁrst principles to demonstrate a theoretical basis for lags between surface ﬂux and soil temperatures. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrated that diel phase lags between surface ﬂux and soil temperature can result from heat and CO2 transport processes alone. While factors other than temperature that vary on a diel basis, such as carbon substrate supply and atmospheric CO2 concentration, can additionally alter lag times and hysteresis patterns to varying degrees, physical transport processes alone are sufﬁcient to create hysteresis. Therefore, the existence of hysteresis does not necessarily indicate soil respiration is inﬂuenced by photosynthetic carbon supply. We also demonstrated how lags can cause errors in Q10 values calculated from regressions of surface ﬂux and soil temperature measured at a single depth. Furthermore, synchronizing surface ﬂux and soil temperature to account for transport-related lags generally does not improve Q10 estimation. In order to calculate the sensitivity of soil respiration to temperature, we suggest using approaches that account for the gradients in temperature and production existing within the soil. We conclude that consideration of heat and CO2 transport processes is a requirement to correctly interpret diel soil respiration patterns.","2011-01","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-08 15:33:33","2019-05-13 23:07:26","515-527","","1","17","","","Interpreting diel hysteresis between soil respiration and temperature","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\FF4DP9U2\Phillips et al. - 2011 - Interpreting diel hysteresis between soil respirat.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Soil; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present findings from two complementary studies that examine how fire modifies soil organic matter properties, and how these modifications influence rates of decomposition and C exchange in black spruce (Picea mariana) ecosystems of interior Alaska. First, we used laboratory incubations to explore soil temperature, moisture, and vegetation effects on CO2 and DOC production rates in burned and unburned soils from three study regions in interior Alaska. Second, at one of the study regions used in the incubation experiments, we conducted intensive field measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (ER) across an unreplicated factorial design of burning (2 year post-fire versus unburned sites) and drainage class (upland forest versus peatland sites). Our laboratory study showed that burning reduced the sensitivity of decomposition to increased temperature, most likely by inducing moisture or substrate quality limitations on decomposition rates. Burning also reduced the decomposability of Sphagnum-derived organic matter, increased the hydrophobicity of feather moss-derived organic matter, and increased the ratio of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in both the upland and peatland sites. At the ecosystem scale, our field measurements indicate that the surface organic soil was generally wetter in burned than in unburned sites, whereas soil temperature was not different between the burned and unburned sites. Analysis of variance results showed that ER varied with soil drainage class but not by burn status, averaging 0.9 ± 0.1 and 1.4 ± 0.1 gCm-2 day-1 in the upland and peatland sites, respectively. However, a more complex general linear model showed that ER was controlled by an interaction between soil temperature, moisture, and burn status, and in general was less variable over time in the burned than in the unburned sites. Together, findings from these studies across different spatial scales suggest that although fire can create some soil climate conditions more conducive to rapid decomposition, rates of C release from soils may be constrained following fire by changes in moisture and/or substrate quality that impede rates of decomposition.","2009-02","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 16:41:05","2019-05-13 23:07:23","57-72","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\JMC329UW\O’Donnell et al. - 2009 - Interactive Effects of Fire, Soil Climate, and Mos.pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; Alaska; Flux; Soil; DOC; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Permafrost sections along coastal and river bank exposures in NE Siberia were studied for organic matter (OM) characteristics and ice content. OM stored in Quaternary permafrost grew, accumulated, froze, partly decomposed, and refroze under different periglacial environments, reflected in specific biogeochemical and cryolithological features. OM in permafrost is represented by twigs, leaves, peat, grass roots, and plant detritus. The vertical distribution of total organic carbon (TOC) in exposures varies from 0.1 wt % of the dry sediment in fluvial deposits to 45 wt% in Holocene peats. Variations in OM parameters are related to changes in vegetation, bioproductivity, pedogenic processes, decomposition, and sedimentation rates during past climate variations. High TOC, high C/N, and low 813C reflect less decomposed OM accumulated under wet, anaerobic soil conditions characteristic of interglacial and interstadial periods. Glacial and stadia! periods are characterized by less variable, low TOC, low C/N, and high 813C values indicating stable environments with reduced bioproductivity and stronger OM decomposition under dryer, aerobic soil conditions.

Aboveground biomass accumulation, vegetative phenology, xylem anatomy, plant hydraulic architecture, foliar stable carbon isotope ratios (delta13C), gas exchange and leaf water relations characteristics were measured. No treatment or population-related differences in leaf water potential were detected. At the end of the first growing season, aboveground biomass was 74 and 44% greater in PIPOmesic in the control and drought treatments, respectively. By early October, 73% of PIPOdry seedlings had formed dormant buds compared with only 15% of PIPOmesic seedlings. Stem theoretical specific conductivity, calculated from tracheid dimensions and packing density, declined from June through September and was nearly twice as high in PIPOmesic during most of the growing season, consistent with measured values of specific conductivity. Intrinsic water-use efficiency based on delta13C values was higher in PIPOdry seedlings for both treatments across all sampling dates. There was a negative relationship between values of delta13C and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity across populations and treatments, consistent with greater stomatal constraints on gas exchange with declining seedling hydraulic capacity. Integrated growing season assimilation and stomatal conductance estimated from foliar delta13C values and photosynthetic CO2-response curves were 6 and 28% lower, respectively, in PIPOdry seedlings. Leaf water potential at the turgor loss point was 0.33 MPa more negative in PIPOdry, independent of treatment.

We also explored whether early and late secondary successional species occupy different portions of trade-off axes. As predicted, species that maintained carbon capture, hydraulic function and leaf area at higher plant water deficits during drought had low photosynthetic rates, xylem hydraulic conductivity and growth rate under non-limiting water supply. Drought tolerance was associated with more dense leaf, stem and root tissues, whereas rapid resource acquisition was associated with greater stem water storage, larger vessel diameter and larger leaf area per mass invested. We offer evidence that the water exploitation versus drought tolerance trade-off drives species differentiation in the ability of tropical dry forest trees to deal with alternating water-drought pulses. However, we detected no evidence of strong functional differentiation between early and late successional species along the proposed trade-off axes, suggesting that the environmental gradient of water availability across secondary successional habitats in the dry tropics does not filter out physiological strategies of water use among species, at least at the seedling stage.","2015-12-18","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-08 15:33:44","2019-05-13 23:05:42","208-217","","","36","","","Exploiting water versus tolerating drought","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\5QBUVEY2\Pineda-García et al. - 2015 - Exploiting water versus tolerating drought water-.pdf","","Journal Article; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use a simulation model with multi-criteria optimization and Pareto optimality to determine branch morphologies in the Pinaceae that minimize the effect of growth limitations due to water stress while simultaneously maximizing carbohydrate gain. Two distinct branch morphologies in the Pareto optimal space resemble Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco and Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl., respectively. These morphologies are distinguished by their performance with respect to two pathways of compensation for hydraulic limitation: minimizing the mean path length to terminal foliage (Pseudotsuga) and minimizing the mean number of junction constrictions to terminal foliage (Abies). Within these rNO groups, we find tradeoffs between the criteria for foliage display and the criteria for hydraulic functioning, which shows that an appropriate framework for considering tree longevity is how trees compensate, simultaneously, for multiple stresses. The diverse morphologies that are found in a typical old-growth conifer forest may achieve compensation in different ways. The method of Pareto optimization that we employ preserves all solutions that are successful in achieving different combinations of criteria. The model for branch development that we use simulates the process of delayed adaptive reiteration (DAR), whereby new foliage grows from suppressed buds within the established branch structure. We propose a theoretical synthesis for the role of morphology in the persistence of old Pseudotsuga based on the characteristics of branch morphogenesis found in branches simulated from the optimal set. (i) The primary constraint on branch growth for Pseudotsuga is the mean path length; (ii) as has been previously noted, DAR is an opportunistic architecture; and (iii) DAR is limited by the number of successive reiterations that can form. We show that Pseudotsuga morphology is not the only solution to old-growth constraints, and we suggest how the model results should be used to guide future empirical investigation based on the two contrasting morphologies and how the morphological contrast may relate to physiological processes.

We investigated the potential of cross-scale interactions to affect the outcome of density reduction in a large-scale silvicultural experiment to better understand options for managing forests under climate change.  2. We measured tree growth and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) based on stable carbon isotopes (d13C) to investigate impacts of density reduction across a range of progressively finer spatial scales: site, stand, hillslope position and neighborhood. In particular, we focused on the influence of treatments beyond the boundaries of treated stands to include impacts on downslope and neighboring stands across sites varying in soil moisture.  3. Trees at the wet site responded with increased growth when compared with trees at the dry site. Additionally, trees in treated stands at the dry site responded with increased iWUE while trees at the wet site showed no difference in iWUE compared to untreated stands.  4. We hypothesized that water is not the primary limiting factor for growth at our sites, but that density reduction released other resources, such as growing space or nutrients to drive the growth response. At progressively finer spatial scales we found that tree responses were not driven by hillslope location (i.e. downslope of treatment) but to changes in local neighborhood tree density.  5. Synthesis. This study demonstrated that water can be viewed as an agent to investigate cross-scale interactions as it links processes operating at coarse to finer spatial scales and vice versa. Consequently, management prescriptions such as density reductions to increase resistance and resilience of trees to climate change, specifically to drought, need to consider cross-scale interactions as specific magnitude and mechanisms of growth responses can only be predicted when multiple scales are taken into account.","2017-09","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-08 19:50:45","2019-05-13 23:04:02","1425-1436","","5","105","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\WA2DVS23\Ruzicka et al. - 2017 - Cross-scale interactions affect tree growth and in.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Growth","","Gilliam, Frank","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We obtained a comprehensive data set for a natural stand of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) and used these data to parameterize the physiologically based model, TREGRO. Representative trees of each of five tree age classes were selected based on population means of morphological, physiological, and nearest neighbor attributes. Differences in key physiological attributes (gas exchange, needle chemistry, elongation growth, needle retention) among the tree age classes were tested. Whole-tree biomass and allocation were determined for seedlings, saplings, and pole-sized trees. Seasonal maxima and minima of gas exchange were similar across all tree age classes. Seasonal minima and a shift to more efficient water use were reached one month earlier in seedlings than in older trees because of decreased soil water availability in the rooting zone of the seedlings. However, carbon isotopic discrimination of needle cellulose indicated increased water-use efficiency with increasing tree age. Seedlings had the lowest needle and branch elongation biomass growth. The amount of needle elongation growth was highest for mature trees and amount of branch elongation growth was highest for saplings. Seedlings had the highest biomass allocation to roots, saplings had the highest allocation to foliage, and pole-sized trees had the highest allocation to woody tissues. Seedlings differed significantly from pole-sized and older trees in most of the physiological traits tested. Predicted changes in biomass with tree age, simulated with the model TREGRO, closely matched those of trees in a natural stand to 30 years of age.","2001-03-01","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-06 23:19:36","2019-05-13 23:03:12","275-286","","5","21","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\5QLTWIBJ\Grulke and Retzlaff - 2001 - Changes in physiological attributes of ponderosa p.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At that time steppe-tundra was the most extensive biome on Earth. Some authors assume that C storage in that biome was very small, similar to today's deserts, and that the terrestrial carbon (C) reservoir increased at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (PHT) by 400- 1300 Gt. To estimate C storage in the entire steppe-tundra biome we used data of C storage in soils of this biome that persisted in permafrost of Siberia and Alaska and developed a model that describes C accumulation in soils and in permafrost. The model shows a slow but consistent C increase in soil when permafrost appears. At the PHT, C-rich frozen loess of Europe and South of Siberia thawed and lost most of its carbon. Soil carbon decreases as tundra-steppe changes to forest, steppes and tundra. As a result, over 1000 Gt C was released to the atmosphere, oceans, and other terrestrial ecosystems. The model results also show that restoring the tundra-steppe ecosystem would enhance soil C storage, while providing other important ecosystem services. [3J The North Siberian plains are covered by an ice-rich permafrost that is tens of meters thick, known locally as yedoma. There is little humus but substantial labile C in yedoma. In continental areas, the C concentration of yedoma varies from 1-5% dry mass (maximum of 30%) [Zimov et al., 2006a; Dutta et al., 2006) and in wetter areas from 2- 30% [Schirrmeister et .a.. 2002]. The average C content of yedoma is ~40 kg m-3 (from dry weight), equivalent to ~400-500 Gt for the North Siberian plains (1 x 106 km2) [Zimov et al., 2006b]. [4] In permafrost soils without sedimentation C accumulates only within the active layer, to the depth of the maximum summer soil thaw. Carbon does not move into the permafrost, During periods of active loess (yedoma) accumulation, however, blowing dust accumulates on the ground surface, and the soil surface and upper boundary of permafrost shift upward, as the lower horizons of the active layer become incorporated into permafrost. Yedoma is therefore derived from only the lowest soil horizon of the mammoth ecosystem. To estimate total-C storage of mammoth biome soils we must know the C storage in its active-layer, which have not been preserved to the present. We must also know the C storage in loess soils that formed as yedoma in Europe and South Siberia before they thawed and lost their C in the Holocene. To solve these problems we developed a model that, describes the vertical C distribution in the soils and in permafrost, under various scenarios of sediment deposition.","2009-01","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 22:34:23","2019-05-13 23:03:05","6","","2","36","","","Carbon storage in permafrost and soils of the mammoth tundra-steppe biome","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\RV9L28BB\Zimov et al. - 2009 - Carbon storage in permafrost and soils of the mamm.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Soil; Perfmafrost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, warming may also enhance plant growth so that photosynthetic carbon dioxide (C02) uptake may, in part, offset respiratory losses. To determine the effects of air and soil warming on C02 exchange in tundra, we established an ecosystem warming experiment- the Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research (CiPEHR) project- in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range in Interior Alaska. We used snow fences coupled with spring snow removal to increase deep soil temperatures and thaw depth (winter warming) and open-top chambers to increase growing season air temperatures (summer warming). Winter warming increased soil temperature (integrated 5-40 em depth) by 1.5 oc, which resulted in a 10% increase in growing season thaw depth. Surprisingly, the additional2kg of thawed soil Cm-2 in the winter warming plots did not result in significant changes in cumulative growing season respiration, which may have been inhibited by soil saturation at the base of the active layer. In contrast to the limited effects on growing-season C dynamics, winter warming caused drastic changes in winter respiration and altered the annual C balance of this ecosystem by doubling the net loss of C02 to the atmosphere. While most changes to the abiotic environment at CiPEHR were driven by winter warming, summer warming effects on plant and soil processes resulted in 20% increases in both gross primary productivity and growing season ecosystem respiration and significantly altered the age and sources of C02 respired from this ecosystem. These results demonstrate the vulnerability of organic C stored in near surface permafrost to increasing temperatures and the strong potential for warming tundra to serve as a positive feedback to global climate change.","2011-03","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 22:34:23","2019-05-13 23:04:53","1394-1407","","3","17","","","Effects of experimental warming of air, soil and permafrost on carbon balance in Alaskan tundra","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\CCTJFKTH\Natali et al. - 2011 - Effects of experimental warming of air, soil and p.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Alaska; Soil; Perfmafrost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we review and synthesize published studies of the effects of biotic disturbances on forest C cycling in the United States and Canada. Primary productivity in stands was reduced, sometimes considerably, immediately following insect or pathogen attack. After repeated growth reductions caused by some insects or pathogens or a single infestation by some bark beetle species, tree mortality occurred, altering productivity and decomposition. In the years following disturbance, primary productivity in some cases increased rapidly as a result of enhanced growth by surviving vegetation, and in other cases increased slowly because of lower forest regrowth. In the decades following tree mortality, decomposition increased as a result of the large amount of dead organic matter. Net ecosystem productivity decreased immediately following attack, with some studies reporting a switch to a C source to the atmosphere, and increased afterward as the forest regrew and dead organic matter decomposed. Large variability in C cycle responses arose from several factors, including type of insect or pathogen, time since disturbance, number of trees affected, and capacity of remaining vegetation to increase growth rates following outbreak. We identified significant knowledge gaps, including limited understanding of carbon cycle impacts among different biotic disturbance types (particularly pathogens), their impacts at landscape and regional scales, and limited capacity to predict disturbance events and their consequences for carbon cycling. We conclude that biotic disturbances can have major impacts on forest C stocks and fluxes and can be large enough to affect regional C cycling. However, additional research is needed to reduce the uncertainties associated with quantifying biotic disturbance effects on the North American C budget.","2012-01","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 00:25:05","2019-05-13 23:04:47","7-34","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\3TQ66CU2\Hicke et al. - 2012 - Effects of biotic disturbances on forest carbon cy.pdf","","Carbon Cycle; Journal Article; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we use a combination of remote sensing and ecosystem modeling to examine the trends in NEP and net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) in this region over the 1985-2007 period, with particular attention to land ownership since management now differs widely between public and private forestland. In the late 1980s, forestland in both ownership classes was subject to high rates of harvesting, and consequently the land was a carbon source (i.e. had a negative NECB). After the policy driven reduction in the harvest level, public forestland became a large carbon sink - driven in part by increasing NEP - whereas private forestland was close to carbon neutral. In the 2003-2007 period, the trend towards carbon accumulation on public lands continued despite a moderate increase in the extent of wildfire. The NWFP was originally implemented in the context of biodiversity conservation, but its consequences in terms of carbon sequestration are also of societal interest Ultimately, management within the NWFP socioecological system will have to consider trade-offs among these and other ecosystem services.","2011-10","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-10 00:22:53","2019-05-13 23:04:10","1318-1325","","7","262","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\4GD48TQG\Turner et al. - 2011 - Decadal trends in net ecosystem production and net.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a network of bubble traps, permanently installed 20 cm and 60 cm beneath the moss surface, to examine controls on ebullition from three collapse bogs in interior Alaska. Overall, ebullition was dominated by episodic events that were associated with changes in atmospheric pressure, and ebullition was mainly a surface process regulated by both seasonal ice dynamics and plant phenology. The majority (>90%) of ebullition occurred in surface peat layers, with little bubble production in deeper peat. During periods of peak plant biomass, bubbles contained acetate-derived CH4 dominated (>90%) by modern C ﬁxed from the atmosphere following permafrost thaw. Post-senescence, the contribution of CH4 derived from thawing permafrost C was more variable and accounted for up to 22% (on average 7%), in the most recently thawed site. Thus, the formation of thermokarst features resulting from permafrost thaw in peatlands stimulates ebullition and CH4 release both by creating ﬂooded surface conditions conducive to CH4 production and bubbling as well as by exposing thawing permafrost C to mineralization.","2014-03","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 17:49:40","2019-05-13 23:03:53","418-431","","3","119","","","Controls on methane released through ebullition in peatlands affected by permafrost degradation","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\TRWDGILW\Klapstein et al. - 2014 - Controls on methane released through ebullition in.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Average carbon consumed was 3.01 kg m-2 during the large fire year and 1.69 kg m-2 during the small fire years. Most of the carbon consumption was from burning of ground layer fuels (85% in the large fire year and 78% in small fire years). Most of the difference in average carbon consumption between large and small fire years was in the consumption of ground layer fuels (2.60 vs. 1.31 kg m-2 during large and small fire years, respectively).

While it is well established that wood density (WD) tends to be lower in early versus late successional tree species, and that WD can influence other aspects of PHA, the interaction of WD, successional stage and the consequent implications for PHA have not been sufficiently explored.

Across all species, WD correlated negatively with vessel diameter and positively with vessel packing density. The ratio of branch:trunk vessel diameter, branch sap flux and whole-tree leaf-specific conductance scaled negatively with branch WD across species. Pioneer species showed greater sap flux in branches than in trunks and a greater leaf-specific hydraulic conductance, suggesting that pioneer species can move greater quantities of water at a given tension gradient.

If forests remain unharvested, they can further mitigate the increases in atmospheric CO2 that result from fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. Alternatively, they can be harvested for bioenergy production and serve as a substitute for fossil fuels, though such a practice could reduce terrestrial C storage and thereby increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the near-term. Here, we used an ecosystem simulation model to ascertain the effectiveness of using forest bioenergy as a substitute for fossil fuels, drawing from a broad range of land-use histories, harvesting regimes, ecosystem characteristics, and bioenergy conversion efﬁciencies. Results demonstrate that the times required for bioenergy substitutions to repay the C Debt incurred from biomass harvest are usually much shorter (< 100 years) than the time required for bioenergy production to substitute the amount of C that would be stored if the forest were left unharvested entirely, a point we refer to as C Sequestration Parity. The effectiveness of substituting woody bioenergy for fossil fuels is highly dependent on the factors that determine bioenergy conversion efﬁciency, such as the C emissions released during the harvest, transport, and ﬁring of woody biomass. Consideration of the frequency and intensity of biomass harvests should also be given; performing total harvests (clear-cutting) at high-frequency may produce more bioenergy than less intensive harvesting regimes but may decrease C storage and thereby prolong the time required to achieve C Sequestration Parity.","2012-11","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 18:51:38","2019-05-13 23:02:38","818-827","","6","4","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\9JEKW97G\Mitchell et al. - 2012 - Carbon debt and carbon sequestration parity in for.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Sequestration; Wood products; Fuel wood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several measures of slope were useful in predictive models of streamwater DOC concentrations suggesting that slope predicts the presence of wetland soils better than current wetland map layers.

Non-destructive depth and cover measurements were used to estimate biomass, carbon and nitrogen content for nine moss and lichen functional groups among eight contrasted habitat types in Pacific Northwest and subarctic U.S.A.

Functional group richness, which did not directly correspond with biomass, was greatest in lowland Picea mariana forests (7.1 6 0.4 functional groups per site). Bootstrap resampling revealed that thirty-two microplots per site were adequate for meeting data quality objectives. Here we present a non-destructive, repeatable and efficient method (sampling time: ca. 60 min per site) for gauging ground layer functions and evaluating responses to ecosystem changes.

Here, we show that aerosols emitted from burning of Alaskan and Siberian peatlands are predominantly brown carbon (BrC) - a class of visible lightabsorbing organic carbon (OC) - with a negligible amount of black carbon content. The mean fuel - based emission factors for OC aerosols ranged from 3.8 to 16.6 g kg -1.

The approximately 20-yr Landsat reflectance trajectories identified for the juniper woodlands of eastern Oregon did not correlate well with changes in juniper crown cover over the same period, suggesting that systematic trends in reflectance are being driven by vegetation other than juniper. Using a random sample of 150 aerial photography plots, we estimate the average aboveground accumulation of carbon in undisturbed juniper woodlands to be 2.9 kg C · m-2 • yr- 1 ; about 0.20 Tg C · yr- 1 across all of Oregon.

Understanding and predicting the dynamics resulting from these complex interactions is crucial for the sustainable stewardship of ecosystems, particularly in the context of rapidly changing environmental conditions. Here we present iLand (the individual-based forest landscape and disturbance model), a novel approach to simulating forest dynamics as an emergent property of environmental drivers, ecosystem processes and dynamic interactions across scales. Our speciﬁc objectives were (i) to describe the model, in particular its novel approach to simulate spatially explicit individual-tree competition for resources over large scales within a process-based framework of physiological resource use, and (ii) to present a suite of evaluation experiments assessing iLands ability to simulate tree growth and mortality for a wide range of forest ecosystems. Adopting an approach rooted in ecological ﬁeld theory, iLand calculates a continuous ﬁeld of light availability over the landscape, with every tree represented by a mechanistically derived, size- and species-dependent pattern of light interference. Within a hierarchical multi-scale framework productivity is derived at stand-level by means of a light-use efﬁciency approach, and downscaled to individuals via local light availability. Allocation (based on allometric ratios) and mortality (resulting from carbon starvation) are modeled at the individual-tree level, accounting for adaptive behavior of trees in response to their environment. To evaluate the model we conducted simulations over the extended environmental gradient of a longitudinal transect in Oregon, USA, and successfully compared results against independently observed productivity estimates (63.4% of variation explained) and mortality patterns in even-aged stands. This transect experiment was furthermore replicated for a different set of species and ecosystems in the Austrian Alps, documenting the robustness and generality of our approach. Model performance was also successfully evaluated for structurally and compositionally complex old-growth forests in the western Cascades of Oregon. Finally, the ability of our approach to address forest ecosystem dynamics at landscape scales was demonstrated by a computational scaling experiment. In simulating the emergence of ecosystem patterns and dynamics as a result of complex process interactions across scales our approach has the potential to contribute crucial capacities to understanding and fostering forest ecosystem resilience under changing climatic conditions.","2012-04","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-09 01:32:56","2019-05-13 23:01:46","87-100","","","231","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\LVG3AAKJ\Seidl et al. - 2012 - An individual-based process model to simulate land.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies addressing the mechanisms for soil carbon release through organic matter decomposition have focused on the effect of changes in the average temperature, with little attention to changes in temperature variability. Anthropogenic activities are likely to modify both the average state and the variability of the climatic system; therefore, the effects of future warming on decomposition should not only focus on trends in the average temperature, but also variability expressed as a change of the probability distribution of temperature. Using analytical and numerical analyses we tested common relationships between temperature and respiration and found that the variability of temperature plays an important role determining respiration rates of soil organic matter. Changes in temperature variability, without changes in the average temperature, can affect the amount of carbon released through respiration over the longterm. Furthermore, simultaneous changes in the average and variance of temperature can either amplify or dampen the release of carbon through soil respiration as climate regimes change. These effects depend on the degree of convexity of the relationship between temperature and respiration and the magnitude of the change in temperature variance. A potential consequence of this effect of variability would be higher respiration in regions where both the mean and variance of temperature are expected to increase, such as in some low latitude regions; and lower amounts of respiration where the average temperature is expected to increase and the variance to decrease, such as in northern high latitudes.","2011-04-19","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-09 17:20:06","2019-05-13 23:01:40","951-961","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\2DPBQM47\Sierra et al. - 2011 - Amplification and dampening of soil respiration by.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Soil; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we present an evaluation of several options for the use of observations in modeling regional carbon dynamics and explore the implications of those options. We calibrated the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model on a hierarchy of three vegetation classification levels for the Alaskan boreal forest: species level, plant-functional-type level (PFT level), and biome level, and we examined the differences in simulated carbon dynamics. Species-specific field-based estimates were directly used to parameterize the model for species-level simulations, while weighted averages based on species percent cover were used to generate estimates for PFT- and biome-level model parameterization. We found that calibrated key ecosystem process parameters differed substantially among species and overlapped for species that are categorized into different PFTs. Our analysis of parameter sets suggests that the PFT-level parameterizations primarily reflected the dominant species and that functional information of some species were lost from the PFT-level parameterizations. The biome-level parameterization was primarily representative of the needle leaf PFT and lost information on broadleaf species or PFT function. Our results indicate that PFT-level simulations may be potentially representative of the performance of species-level simulations while biome-level simulations may result in biased estimates. Improved theoretical and empirical justifications for grouping species into PFTs or biomes are needed to adequately represent the dynamics of ecosystem functioning and structure.","2013-07","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 00:00:43","2019-05-13 23:01:28","983-993","","3","118","","","Alternative ways of using field-based estimates to calibrate ecosystem models and their implications for carbon cycle studies","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\M4P23GSY\He et al. - 2013 - Alternative ways of using field-based estimates to.pdf","","Carbon Cycle; Modeling; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The scenario considers climate patterns that may change if the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (C02), or its greenhouse gas equivalent, were to double over pre-Industrial Revolution values. Given the current rate of increase in atmospheric C02 concentration, doubling could occur within the next 50 to 100 years. The Columbia River basin is in a transition climate zone between predominating maritime to the west, arctic to the north, and continental to the east. Consequently, it is difficult to characterize through means and averages. Therefore, many of the current stochastic methods for developing climate-change scenarios cannot directly apply to the basin. To circumvent this problem, a composite approach was taken to generate a climate scenario that considers knowledge of current regional climate controls, available output from general circulation and regional climate models, and observed changes in climate. The resulting climate-change scenario suggests that precipitation could increase substantially during winter (+20 to +50 percent) and moderately during spring and autumn (+5 to +35 percent). A slight decrease (0 to -5 percent) in summer precipitation is possible, except for the southeastern portions of the basin that may experience an increase in convective precipitation (+5 percent). Low-elevation (<I kilometer) temperatures throughout the year may increase 1 to 3 ""C, with greatest increases during winter. This amount of temperature change is possible because of an expected loss of low-elevation snow cover. At high elevations, increased cloud cover could cause average temperatures to decrease during winter but be synchronized with possible warming at low elevations during summer. The diurnal range of temperature could decrease, especially in summer and autumn.","1997","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-06 18:15:48","","9","","","","","","","","","","Research Paper","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\HKRH8A35\Ferguson - 1997 - A climate-change scenario for the Columbia River B.pdf","","Research Paper; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-RP-499","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we assessed the feasibility of switching from fossil fuels to wood energy in rural Alaskan villages in forested regions of interior Alaska. Modeling results based on recent data on rural energy use, demographics, economics, and forest dynamics indicated that the installation costs of biomass systems would be recouped within 10 years for at least 21 communities in the region. In addition, results showed that all but the largest remote communities in the interior could meet all their electrical demand and some heating needs with a sustainable harvest of biomass within a radius of 10 km of the village. Marketable carbon credits may add an additional incentive for fuel conversion, particularly if U.S. prices eventually rise to match European levels.

Emission factors for total particulate matter, particulate matter 10 micrograms in size and less, particulate matter 2.5 micrograms in size and less, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nonmethane hydrocarbons have been developed from the tests. In addition, combustion efficiency and the rates of fuel consumption and heat release were derived from real time measurements of CO, CO2, temperature, and vertical mass flux. The highest combustion efficiencies observed for the flaming phase were from tests at the crushed sites, where most flaming phase emission factors were lower than for the other areas.

Meanwhile, this carbon sink is threatened by deforestation, climate change and natural disturbances. As a result, U.S. Forest Service policies require that National Forests assess baseline carbon stocks and influences of disturbance and management activities on carbon stocks and trends, with the goal of incorporating carbon stewardship into management activities. To accomplish these objectives, we utilize Forest Inventory and Analysis datasets and remote sensing-based disturbance histories within a carbon modeling framework to estimate past and present carbon stocks and trends for each national forest. We integrate three forest carbon models: 1) Carbon Calculation Tool, 2) Forest Carbon Management Framework, and 3) Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon model, to calculate baseline carbon stocks and the relative impacts of disturbance and non-disturbance factors on forest carbon stocks and flux. Results of the assessments ultimately help forest managers quantify carbon consequences of broad forest management strategies and project-level decisions.

The archive of publicly available Landsat images dating back to the 1970s can be used to predict historic forest biomass dynamics. In addition, increasing regional scale availability and high sensitivity of LiDAR for biomass mapping also needs exploration of its utility in back-projection modeling. This study has combined recent national forest inventory (NFI) data (2007-2011) with the Landsat data from 1986-2011 and a regional LiDAR dataset acquired by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to assess the potential of the remote sensing data in predicting aboveground forest biomass back to the 1990 baseline used in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change reporting in the US. Since obtaining cloud-free Landsat images at required seasons for a regional or national study is unlikely, pixel level polynomial models were fitted to a suite of time-series predictors obtained from cloud-free Landsat data of a single scene in Minnesota such that each predictor represented only one growing season between 1986 and 2011. Similarly, selected LiDAR variables were back-projected using Landsat metrics as explanatory variables. The rational for this effort was to obtain a wall-to-wall inventory for any target year that does not have remote sensing data by combining a set of projected predictors and current NFI data. Several candidate models were developed to produce biomass maps for the year 2000 to compare the outputs with the extant map of National Biomass and Carbon Dataset (NBCD) circa 2000 and annual NFI plot measurements. We found that the model including back-projected LiDAR metrics did not significantly improve the prediction accuracy as compared to the model based only on projected Landsat metrics. As the polynomial-projected Landsat-based model provided accuracy similar to the NBCD model, the former may be used for reference mapping back to 1990.","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-11-30 18:08:25","","104-109","","","","","","","","","","New Directions in Inventory Techniques & Applications Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) Symposium 2015","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\NIMDAU9Z\Deo et al. - 2015 - USING LANDSAT TIME-SERIES AND LIDAR TO INFORM ABOV.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; GTR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We answer this question using Landsat time series data and a unique interpretation approach, TimeSync, a plotbased Landsat visualization and data collection tool. Original analyses were based on a stratified two-stage cluster sample design that included interpretation of 3858 forested plots. From these data, we derived annual plot-based estimates (with uncertainties) of rates of forest decline from 1985-2012. Noted was a dramatic national-level increase in rates from the mid-90s (<1% of total forest per year) to 2000 (nearly 3% per year), with these elevated rates persisting for most of the past decade. Although forest decline was observed in eastern forests, the overwhelming proportion was in western forests, where rates reached as high as 8% per year. Increases in observed rates of decline exhibited a strong statistical relationship with the coupling of increasing summertime temperatures and decreasing precipitation beginning in the mid-90s. Using a statistical model, we developed a predictive relationship between forest decline and climate that allowed us to project the likelihood of forest decline forward to 2100 using expected climate projections. This analysis revealed that, even under reduced carbon emission scenarios, US forests are likely to be increasingly vulnerable to climate change. We are currently collecting more TimeSync interpretations (~10,000) and developing improved modeling strategies, and will present results from this more recent analysis.","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-05 19:02:52","","189-189","","","","","","","","","","New Directions in Inventory Techniques & Applications Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) Symposium 2015","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\U4K842IB\Cohen et al. - 2015 - US FORESTS ARE SHOWING INCREASED RATES OF DECLINE .pdf","","Pools; GTR; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"SGBA7HSA","report","2013","Harmon, Mark E","The theoretical and empirical basis for understanding the impact of thinning on carbon stores in forests","","","","","","Thinning of forests has been proposed as a means to increase the carbon stores of forests. The justification often offered is that thinning increases stand productivity, which in turn leads to higher carbon stores. While thinning of forests clearly increases the growth of residual trees and increases the amount of harvested carbon compared to an unthinned stand, there is little theoretical or empirical basis for believing that this activity increases the average carbon stores of forests. By removing trees, leaf area is temporarily decreased and carbon input to the forest via photosynthesis is also temporarily decreased. In theory, reducing the input of carbon to a forest will reduce its average carbon stores. Moreover, by increasing the amount of carbon harvested over a rotation, a greater proportion of carbon is removed, which general ecosystem theory also predicts will lower average carbon stores. The few empirical studies that have examined long-term impact of thinning on carbon stores have indicated that as thinning intensity increases either in amount or frequency, the average longterm carbon store decreases. Simulation models indicate very similar trends. Both results are in line with predictions from general ecosystem theory. Despite the finding that thinning reduces average carbon stores relative to not thinning, this management practice may lead to increases of carbon stores compared to a system of clearcut harvesting. By replacing clearcut harvesting with a series of partial harvests, carbon stores in forests could be increased significantly.","2013-08","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 19:45:09","","115-115","","","","","","","","","","General Technical Report","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\SPTU7MNS\Harmon - 2013 - The theoretical and empirical basis for understand.pdf","","Management; GTR; Silviculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-880","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research has indicated that large trees in general, and old-growth forests in particular, sequester substantial amounts of C annually. C sequestration rates are thought to peak and decline with stand age but the timing and controls are not well-understood. The objectives of this study were to determine how the balance of tree growth, mortality, and dead wood decay vary by plant community type, site productivity, and stand age. We compiled remeasured tree and dead wood estimates from 8,767 inventory plots on Pacific Northwest Region National Forest lands and assessed changes by climax plant association zones (PAZs) and site productivity estimates of mean annual increment at culmination (MAI). Estimated maximum C density for old-growth stands (greater or equal to 300 years old) varied significantly by MAI class within PAZ, but on average stands accumulated 66% of maximum stores by age 100. We did not see a decline in live tree production in older stands in moderate and low MAI classes, but a 33% reduction in high MAI classes. We found that mortality in undisturbed stands increased with stand age such that the net growth in live tree biomass, and the change in total C, was not significantly different from zero in stands over age 400 (0.15 +/- 0.64 Mg/ha/yr for total C, 95% confidence interval). Mortality of large trees (>100 cm diameter) exceeded growth, but trees were growing into the larger size classes at a high-enough rate that a net increase in large tree C was seen across the region. Even though large trees accumulated C at a faster rate than small trees on an individual basis, their contribution to C sequestration was smaller on an area basis, and their importance relative to small trees declined in older stands compared to younger stands.","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-02-23 00:45:56","","153-158","","","","","","","","","","New Directions in Inventory Techniques & Applications Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) Symposium 2015","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\DCTNUP6Z\Gray - 2015 - THE ROLE OF OLD FORESTS AND BIG TREES IN FOREST CA.pdf","","Pools; Sequestration; GTR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One example of the additional measurements is the post fire index (PFI), which is a fire severity classification based on post-fire crown observations. Stands that showed presence or no evidence of residual green crowns were assigned to PFI classes Alive and Dead respectively. The repeated measurements of 109 burned FIA plots allowed us to quantify gains and losses in dead and life woody carbon pools in the first five years following a wildfire. We used a mixed model to estimate the change in each woody carbon pool as a function of PFI, years since fire, and pre-fire woody carbon. Most of the 109 plots in this study burned with low to moderate severity and the post-fire carbon trajectories by pool differed from those observed for the stands that burned with high severity.

With the advent of this new accounting system, however, a need persists for information at smaller scales. For example, National Forest managers are being asked to incorporate carbon management into Forest planning.

Soil organic carbon is also a key indicator of soil quality as it affects essential biological, chemical, and physical soil functions such as nutrient cycling, water retention, and soil structure maintenance. Much of the SOC on earth is found in forest ecosystems and is thought to be relatively stable. That said, there are a growing number of studies documenting the sensitivity of SOC to global change drivers, particularly in the northern circumpolar region where approximately 50% of the global SOC is stored. In the United States (US), SOC in forests is monitored by the national forest inventory (NFI) conducted by the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program within the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service. The FIA program currently uses SOC predictions based on SSURGO/STATSGO data to populate the national forest inventory. Most of the point samples used to obtain estimates of SOC in forests from the SSURGO/ STATSGO data are from non-forested sites. The FIA program has been consistently measuring soil attributes as part of the NFI since 2001 and has recently amassed a nearly complete inventory of SOC in forests in the conterminous US and coastal Alaska. As an initial step towards developing a map of SOC in forests of the US we will 1) describe the inventory of soil variables in the NFI, 2) compare model predictions of SOC density with estimates from the NFI, 3) evaluate new estimation approaches to replace existing model predictions, and 4) describe next steps towards the development of data-driven visualization products that rely on existing and emerging remotely sensed data products, NFI measurements, and auxiliary environmental data sources.","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-05 22:48:17","","361-361","","","","","","","","","","New Directions in Inventory Techniques & Applications Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) Symposium 2015","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\I7A64E8L\Domke et al. - 2015 - ESTIMATING CARBON IN FOREST SOILS OF THE UNITED ST.pdf","","Pools; GTR; Soil; FIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order for these countries to receive this monetary benefit, they must develop and implement forest monitoring, reporting and validation (MRV) programs that effectively quantify the amount and change of “forested” land, the “health” of the forests, and estimate the amount of carbon in these forests. The USFS International Programs is involved in REDD+ by assisting these developing countries in the development of these MRV programs by facilitating technical exchanges with experts from the United States. Not only do countries benefit from this technical expertise, but awareness within all parties being part of a global community is raised, as well as the importance of effective across border communication.

Based on recent findings from a national gap analysis and comprehensive assessment of the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (USFS-FIA) component ratio method (CRM) for estimating both biomass and carbon using historical individual tree biomass data, alternative approaches for predicting forest biomass and carbon were evaluated. The different CRM approaches tested included: 1) development and use of a unified stem taper equation to estimate stem volume; 2) updated model forms and parameters for predicting biomass components; and 3) comparison of alternative wood density values. Overall, these modifications show the potential to improve estimates of forest biomass and carbon, but additional testing is required before implementation.","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-10 01:29:14","","125-132","","","","","","","","","","New Directions in Inventory Techniques & Applications Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) Symposium 2015","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\FS2455TH\Weiskittel et al. - 2015 - ADVANCING INDIVIDUAL TREE BIOMASS PREDICTION ASSE.pdf","","Modeling; GTR; FIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These fluxes appear to be correlated with intense soil erosion. While concentration on N, P and dissolved C do not significantly fluctuate, their total fluxes vary by five to twenty times when flow volumes increase by on order of magnitude during peak flow rates. These large fluxes of N, P and dissolved C are transferred to downstream watersheds affecting effectively environmental ecosystems of upstream and downstream areas. These fluxes are also highly correlated with wild fire triggered erosion. Erosion has been modeled using ERMiT: Erosion Risk Management Tool, developed specifically for post-fire assessments that predicts the probability associated with a given amount of single-storm soil erosion in tons/acre for a given hillslope topography in each of five years following forest wildfire. Erosion modeling allows changing vegetation cover as the function of severity of forest disturbances. Input data in erosion modeling include types of soils, types of vegetation cover, slope angle, burn severity level, and hydrologic conditions for the modeled area. Niitrogen fluxes from two study area have been correlated with ERMiT modeled erosion. Both areas display high correlation between erosion and nitrogen fluxes, with correlation coefficients higher than 0.7.","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 22:10:25","","101-101","","","","","","","","","","New Directions in Inventory Techniques & Applications Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) Symposium 2015","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\3T8W9ABU\Matyjasik et al. - 2015 - FOREST DISTURBANCES TRIGGER EROSION CONTROLLED FLU.pdf","","GTR; Flux; DOC; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is currently a very dynamic region with rising temperatures, melting permafrost, changes in vegetation, fire, carbon, and water cycles due to a warming climate. This is the last forested area in the United States where the national Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program has not been implemented largely due to its remoteness, size, lack of infrastructure, complex logistics, and cost. A pilot study was conducted in the Tanana Valley in 2014 aimed at testing a cost-effective inventory design that utilized a combination of field plots containing new protocols in conjunction with the latest airborne, remote sensing technology. In addition to the national FIA protocols, some interior specific variables tested were: a modified P3 soils protocol (carbon, permafrost), ground cover (mosses and lichens), tree cores (ring analysis), a modified P3 down wood protocol (carbon), and a second microplot (to better characterize small diameter trees). The success of the pilot can be attributed to developing cooperative partnerships between the US Forest Service (USFS), NASA, US Fish and Wildlife Service, State of Alaska-Division of Forestry (DOF), and the University of Alaska-Fairbanks (UAF). Plans for initial phases of implementation beginning in 2016 are moving forward with joint venture agreements between the USFS, DOF, and UAF to continue installing FIA plots in the Tanana Valley. Developing additional partnerships with organizations like the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and Native Corporations will be critical for implementation of the interior Alaska inventory. The long term goal is full implementation with a 1/5 intensity FIA grid, approximately 4600 plots over 10-12 years, divided into five inventory units, including a large aviation component, with an estimated average annual budget of $2.5 million per year.","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 23:06:36","","197-197","","","","","","","","","","New Directions in Inventory Techniques & Applications Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) Symposium 2015","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\2BQVRZ3Z\Mueller and Irvine - 2015 - COLLABORATING FOR SUCCESS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE I.pdf","","Biomass; Alaska; GTR; FIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the complexity and diversity of these systems poses a challenge to interpreting data patterns. The availability and accessibility of data and tools often determine the method selected for forest assessment. Capacity building is fundamental to ensure that sampling methods, data analysis and use of tools are efficiently and sustainably appropriated. FAO has trained people from over 30 countries to develop tools and databases to improve forest resource assessment. In highly diverse inventory plots in the tropics, the use of one single pantropical allometric equation (models for the estimation of forest elements such as biomass and carbon stock) for all trees inventoried is the norm in many countries. However these equations present large biases and/or uncertainties for several tropical regions of the world, due to their compositional and structural complexity, and their limited representation in the original datasets used to build the pantropical model. In order to contribute to the elimination of bias and increasing accuracy, we propose a combined approach to stand biomass estimation following statistical methods that depends on both the availability of equations and/ or destructive data, and the existing capacities in the country. We illustrate the methods through different scenarios of existing technical capabilities and data availability, taking GlobAllomeTree as a source for allometric equations. GlobAllomeTree provides access to existing available allometric equations and relevant documentation, supports the development of new models and builds a network of national experts for data-sharing and collaboration. The different alternative approaches proposed present a realistic roadmap towards the reduction of uncertainties and biases in reporting national stocks.","2015","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 00:24:10","","64-64","","","","","","","","","","New Directions in Inventory Techniques & Applications Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) Symposium 2015","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\R9FLIZVA\Henry et al. - 2015 - ASSESSMENT OF NATIONAL BIOMASS IN COMPLEX FORESTS .pdf","","Biomass; GTR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of them is model selection uncertainty: one has to choose among multiple empirical equations and conversion factors that can be plausibly justified as locally applicable to calculate the carbon store from inventory measurements such as tree height and diameter at breast height (DBH). Here we quantify the model-selection uncertainty for the five most numerous tree species in six counties of northwest Oregon, USA. Results: The results of our study demonstrate that model-selection error may introduce 20 to 40% uncertainty into a live-tree carbon estimate, possibly making this form of error the largest source of uncertainty in estimation of live-tree carbon stores. The effect of model selection could be even greater if models are applied beyond the height and DBH ranges for which they were developed. Conclusions: Model-selection uncertainty is potentially large enough that it could limit the ability to track forest carbon with the precision and accuracy required by carbon accounting protocols. Without local validation based on detailed measurements of usually destructively sampled trees, it is very difficult to choose the best model when there are several available. Our analysis suggests that considering tree form in equation selection may better match trees to existing equations and that substantial gaps exist, in terms of both species and diameter ranges, that are ripe for new model-building effort.","2011-12","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-03-05 18:46:37","2019-05-13 23:05:11","16","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\UIS987RY\Melson et al. - 2011 - Estimates of live-tree carbon stores in the Pacifi.pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When ice-rich permafrost thaws, it creates a localized surface subsidence called thermokarst terrain, which changes the soil microenvironment. We used soil profile CO2 measurements to understand the response of below ground C emissions for different soil depths from upland tundra as a result of permafrost thaw and thermokarst development. We established sites in central Alaska, where permafrost thaw and thermokarst development had been monitored for the past 2 decades. Cumulative growing season CO2 production averaged for 3 years (2005-2007) ranged from 177 to 270 g CO2-C m-2 and was lowest in the least disturbed moist acidic tundra and highest where thawing of permafrost and thermokarst was most pronounced. We were able to explain 55% of variability in growing season soil CO2 production using surface subsidence, soil temperature, and site differences. This was likely a direct effect of permafrost thaw and thermo karst development and an indirect effect of changes in microsite soil temperature and surface moisture content, which stimulated soil organic matter decomposition and root respiration. We also observed unusually high CO2 concentrations in the early growing season, which may be attributable to trapped CO2 within air pockets in the frozen soil.

Effective biodiversity conservation will require better landowner incentives for restoration and protection of ecosystems. Many services produced from healthy, functioning landscapes are not well recognized in current conservation incentive structures, including sequestering or storing carbon in trees and soil, providing fish and wildlife habitat, filtering water, and reducing damages from natural disasters. Most existing incentive programs pay landowners to protect and restore a specific service rather than the suite of services produced from well-functioning ecosystems. Various incentive programs need to be better integrated or new programs need to be developed that value a greater proportion of the ecological benefits that flow from ecosystems. One promising option is to allow landowners to bundle or stack payments for ecosystem services. This option, however, also presents issues that need to be addressed to ensure ecological goals and economic efficiency are achieved. Current efforts underway address some of these issues. Specifically, collaborative efforts among public and private entities in the Pacific Northwest and Chesapeake Bay region are developing accounting tools to measure ecosystem services and test policies for bundling services and stacking payments on the ground.

Tree mortality caused by bark beetle outbreaks alters carbon cycling in the first several years following the disturbance by reducing stand-level primary production and by increasing the amount of dead organic matter available for decomposition. The few studies of biogeochemical cycling following outbreaks have shown a range of impacts from small responses of net carbon fluxes in the first several years after a severe outbreak to large forest areas that are sources of carbon to the atmosphere for decades. To gain more understanding about causes of this range of responses, we used an ecosystem model to assess impacts of different bark beetle outbreak conditions on coupled carbon and nitrogen cycling. We modified the Community Land Model with prognostic carbon and nitrogen to include prescribed bark beetle outbreaks. We then compared control simulations (without a bark beetle outbreak) to simulations with various levels of mortality severity, durations of outbreak, and snagfall dynamics to quantify the range of carbon flux responses and recovery rates of net ecosystem productivity to a range of realistic outbreak conditions. Our simulations illustrate that, given the large variability in bark beetle outbreak conditions, a wide range of responses in carbon and nitrogen dynamics can occur. The fraction of trees killed, delay in snagfall, snagfall rate, and management decisions about harvesting killed trees will have major impacts on post outbreak carbon fluxes for several decades and post outbreak carbon stocks up to 100 years.","2011-12-23","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-06 17:25:01","2019-05-13 23:11:02","15","","G4","116","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\NAXR7HPM\Edburg et al. - 2011 - Simulating coupled carbon and nitrogen dynamics fo.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a coupled human and natural systems framework and an agent-based landscape model to examine how alternative management scenarios affect fire and ecosystem services metrics in a fire-prone multiownership landscape in the eastern Cascades of Oregon. Our model incorporated existing models of vegetation succession and fire spread and information from original empirical studies of landowner decision making. Our findings indicate that alternative management strategies can have variable effects on landscape outcomes over 50 years for fire, socioeconomic, and ecosystem services metrics. For example, scenarios with federal restoration treatments had slightly less high-severity fire than a scenario without treatment; exposure of homes in the wildland-urban interface to fire was also slightly less with restoration treatments compared to no management. Treatments appeared to be more effective at reducing high-severity fire in years with more fire than in years with less fire. Under the current management scenario, timber production could be maintained for at least 50 years on federal lands. Under an accelerated restoration scenario, timber production fell because of a shortage of areas meeting current stand structure treatment targets. Trade-offs between restoration outcomes (e.g., open forests with large fire-resistant trees) and habitat for species that require dense older forests were evident. For example, the proportional area of nesting habitat for northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) was somewhat less after 50 years under the restoration scenarios than under no management. However, the amount of resilient older forest structure and habitat for white-headed woodpecker (Leuconotopicus albolarvatus) was higher after 50 years under active management. More carbon was stored on this landscape without management than with management, despite the occurrence of high-severity wildfire. Our results and further applications of the model could be used in collaborative settings to facilitate discussion and development of policies and practices for fire-prone landscapes.","2017","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-09 19:11:38","2019-05-13 23:13:24","55","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\5HUSH8VU\Spies et al. - 2017 - Using an agent-based model to examine forest manag.pdf","","Fire; Management; Modeling; Journal Article; Oregon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we used a time series of Landsat remote sensing images and a climate-driven carbon cycle process model to evaluate carbon fluxes at the ecoregion scale in western Oregon. Results: Thirteen percent of total forest area in the West Cascades ecoregion was disturbed during the reference interval (1991-2010). The disturbance regime was dominated by harvesting (59 % of all area disturbed), with lower levels of fire (23 %), and pest/pathogen mortality (18 %). Ecoregion total Net Ecosystem Production was positive (a carbon sink) in all years, with greater carbon uptake in relatively cool years. Localized carbon source areas were associated with recent harvests and fire. Net Ecosystem Exchange (including direct fire emissions) showed greater interannual variation and became negative (a source) in the highest fire years. Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance (i.e. change in carbon stocks) was more positive on public that private forestland, because of a lower disturbance rate, and more positive in the decade of the 1990s than in the warmer and drier 2000s because of lower net ecosystem production and higher direct fire emissions in the 2000s.

Apparently conflicting experimental findings could be the result of differences in genetic potential and resource availability, different experimental conditions and the fact that many studies have focused on individual components of the system rather than the whole ecosystem. Here we present results of an in situ experiment on the response of an intact native ecosystem to elevated CO2. An undisturbed patch of tussock tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska, was enclosed in greenhouses in which the CO2 level, moisture and temperature could be controlled, and was subjected to ambient (340 p.p.m.) and elevated (680 p.p.m.) levels of CO2and temperature (+4 °C). Air humidity, precipitation and soil water table were maintained at ambient control levels. For a doubled CO2 level alone, complete homeostasis of the CO2 flux was re-established within three years, whereas the regions exposed to a combination of higher temperatures and doubled CO2 showed persistent fertilization effect on net ecosystem carbon sequestration over this time. This difference may be due to enhanced sink activity from the direct effects of higher temperatures on growth and to indirect effects from enhanced nutrient supply caused by increased mineralization. These results indicate that the responses of native ecosystems to elevated CO2 may not always be positive, and are unlikely to be straightforward. Clearly, CO2 fertilization effects must always be considered in the context of genetic limitation, resource availability and other such factors.","1994","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 22:33:49","","500-503","","","371","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\NTZC6STC\Oechel et al. - 1994 - Transient nature of co2 fertilization in Arctic tu.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SUVA was always lower in lateral subsurface flow than in stream water at the seasonal scale. even during the wet period when other solutes were similar between lateral subsurface flow and stream water. This suggested mixing of deep groundwater and shallow transient groundwater was different at the hillslope scale compared to the catchment scale. DOC and DON sources were finite (production of DOC and DON from the hillslope soils appeared to be limited) at the seasonal scale since DOC and DON concentrations were significantly lower during the wet period compared to the transition period during stormflow conditions. This was also reflected in the DOC and DON peak and flow weighted storm event concentrations and antecedent soil moisture relationship where drier conditions (less prior flushing) resulted in the highest DOC and DON peak and flow weighted storm event concentrations.

The OR of the terrestrial biosphere must be well characterized to accurately estimate the terrestrial CO2 sink using atmospheric measurements of changing O2 and CO2 levels. To estimate the OR of the terrestrial biosphere, measurements are needed of changes in the OR of aboveground and belowground carbon pools associated with decadal timescale disturbances (e.g., land use change and fire). The OR of aboveground pools can be measured using conventional approaches including elemental analysis. However, measuring the OR of soil carbon pools is technically challenging, and few soil OR data are available. In this paper we test three solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques for measuring soil OR, all based on measurements of the closely related parameter, organic carbon oxidation state (Cox). Two of the three techniques make use of a molecular mixing model which converts NMR spectra into concentrations of a standard suite of biological molecules of known Cox. The third technique assigns Cox values to each peak in the NMR spectrum. We assess error associated with each technique using pure chemical compounds and plant biomass standards whose Cox and OR values can be directly measured by elemental analyses. The most accurate technique, direct polarization solid-state l3C NMR with the molecular mixing model, agrees with elemental analyses to ±0.036 Cox units (±0.009 OR units). Using this technique, we show a large natural variability in soil Cox and OR values. Soil Cox values have a mean of -0.26 and a range from -0.45 to 0.30, corresponding to OR values of 1.08 ± 0.06 and a range from 0.96 to 1.22. We also estimate the OR of the carbon flux from a boreal forest fire. Analysis of soils from nearby intact soil profiles imply that soil carbon losses associated with the fire had an OR of 1.091 (±O.003). Fire appears to be a major factor driving the soil C pool to higher oxidation states and lower OR values, Episodic fluxes caused by disturbances like fire may have substantially different ORs from ecosystem respiration fluxes and therefore should be better quantified to reduce uncertainties associated with our understanding of the global atmospheric carbon budget.","2009-05-19","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 00:34:26","","14","","G2","114","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ENPX4M7A\Hockaday et al. - 2009 - Measurement of soil carbon oxidation state and oxi.pdf","","Journal Article; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is some debate on the impact humans have on climate change but increasing global CO2 levels are well documented. Burning of fossil fuels is the primary contributor for greenhouse gas emissions. However, loss of forestland is a major concern and deforestation globally accounts for about 20% of total greenhouse gas emissions (Food and Agriculture Organization 2005). One of the major forestry challenges here in the United States is reducing the loss of forestland from development. Foresters have a critical role to play in forest management and carbon sequestration to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and if deforestation is the problem, then forestry can be part of the solution.

Fuel consumption is the basic process that leads to heat absorbing emissions called greenhouse gas and other aerosol emissions that can impact atmospheric and ecosystem processes, carbon stocks, and land surface reﬂectance. It is a critical requirement for greenhouse gas emission inventories. There are several fuel consumption models widely used by scientists and land managers including the First Order Fire Effects Model, Consume, and CanFIRE. However, these models have not been thoroughly evaluated with an independent, quality assured, fuel consumption data set. Furthermore, anecdotal evidence indicates the models have limited ability to predict consumption of speciﬁc fuel bed categories such as tree crowns, deep organic layers, and rotten logs that can contribute signiﬁcantly to greenhouse gases. If we are to move forward in our ability to assess the contribution of wildland ﬁre to greenhouse gas to the atmosphere, our current fuel consumption models must be evaluated and modiﬁed to improve their predictive capabilities. Finally, information is lacking on how much black and brown carbon from wildland ﬁre is generated during the combustion process and how much remains on site becoming sequestered in soils, partially offsetting greenhouse gas emissions.

This study explored biomass distributions across an entire watershed simultaneously, from ocean to glacial iceﬁelds, in Southeast Alaska. Utilizing LiDAR and ground surveys, biomass was modelled throughout the landscape and distributions are described statistically. The dominant driver of biomass distributions at this scale (controlling for elevation) was the ﬂow of water through the landscape: areas of higher water accumulation typically had low biomass (often <10 Mg·ha–1), whereas well-drained areas supported biomass approaching 950 Mg·ha–1. This relationship was strong at all elevations; only riparian locations (typically well-drained soils) maintained high biomass at low slopes. Exposure to stand-replacing disturbances, often a dominant driver, was only a minor factor.

Throughout a 17-month sampling period, mean values of branch NSC from the 57 m trees ranged between 30 and 377% greater than the 2 m trees. Branch NSC was inversely correlated with midday shoot water potential ('Pi), shoot osmotic potential at full turgor ( '¥,) and shoot extension. Temporal fluctuation in branch NSC was inversely correlated with height, and positively correlated with midday 'Pi, '¥, and shoot extension. The positive correlation between height and storage of NSC, and the negative correlation between NSC storage and shoot extension provide evidence that size-related growth decline in trees is not strongly associated with constraints on photosynthesis. The negative correlation between height and fluctuation in NSC suggests that mobilization of photosynthate in taller trees is constrained by some factor such as reductions in turgor-driven cell expansion or constraints on phloem transport.","2011","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-14 15:53:57","","1920-1930","","11","34","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\SU6CQFMD\Woodruff and Meinzer - 2011 - Water stress, shoot growth and storage of non-stru.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Models built with the smaller set of targeted ground data resulted in lower plot-level mapping error (root mean square error) and higher apparent explanatory power (R2) than those built with the larger, more widely distributed inventory data. However, in two of the three ecoregions considered, predictions derived from models built with the smaller ground data set displayed a bias relative to those built with the larger but noisier inventory data. A modeling exercise, wherein mapped forest age was translated into carbon, demonstrated how nonlinear ecological models can magnify these prediction biases over landscapes.

This has led to some dispute over the role of stored nonstructural C compounds as indicators of a tree's current demands for photosynthate. Much of the uncertainty surrounding this issue could be resolved by developing a better understanding of the potential functions of non-structural C stored within trees. In addition to functioning as a buffer to reconcile temporal asynchrony between C demand and supply, the storage of non-structural C compounds may be under greater regulation than commonly recognized. We propose that in the face of environmental stochasticity, large, long-lived trees may require larger C investments in storage pools as safety margins than previously recognized, and that an important function of these pools may be to maintain hydraulic transport, particularly during episodes of severe stress. If so, survival and long-term growth in trees remain a function of C availability. Given that drought, freeze-thaw events and increasing tree height all impose additional constraints on vascular transport, the common trend of an increase in non-structural carbohydrate concentrations with tree size, drought or cold is consistent with our hypothesis. If the regulated maintenance of relatively large constitutive stored C pools in trees serves to maintain hydraulic integrity, then the minimum thresholds are expected to vary depending on the specific tissues, species, environment, growth form and habit. Much research is needed to elucidate the extent to which allocation of C to storage in trees is a passive vs. an active process, the specific functions of stored C pools, and the factors that drive active C allocation to storage.","2012-01-02","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-08 19:52:57","","764-775","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\T7UXEE7U\Sala et al. - 2012 - Carbon dynamics in trees feast or famine.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, we used fluorescence characterization of DOC and laboratory bioassays to assess how climate-induced soil warming may impact the quality and bioavailability of DOC delivered to fluvial systems. Soil temperature was the strongest control on SOC turnover, with wetland type and soil depth less important in controlling CO2 flux and extractable DOC. The high temperature incubation increased average CO2 yield by *40 and *25% for DOC suggesting PCTR soils contain a sizeable pool of readily biodegradable SOC that can be mineralized to DOC and CO2 with future climate warming. Fluxes of CO2 were positively correlated to both extractable DOC and percent bioavailable DOC during the last few months of the incubation suggesting mineralization of SOC to DOC is a strong control of soil respiration rates. Whether the net result is increased export of either carbon form will depend on the balance between the land to water transport of DOC and the ability of soil microbial communities to mineralize DOC to CO2.","2017-04","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 16:13:35","2019-05-13 23:14:01","165-179","","2","133","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\SWJQ46H9\Fellman et al. - 2017 - Vulnerability of wetland soil carbon stocks to cli.pdf","","Wetlands; Pools; Journal Article; Alaska; Soil; Aquatic; DOC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The thawing of permafrost with warming occurs both gradually and catastrophically, exposing organic C to microbial decomposition. Other aspects of ecosystem dynamics can be altered by climate change along with thawing permafrost, such as growing season length, plant growth rates and species composition, and ecosystem energy exchange.

Disturbances caused by climate warming in arctic, subarctic, and boreal environments can result in significant redistribution of C among major reservoirs with potential global impacts. We divide the current northern high-latitude SOC pools into (1) near-surface soils where SOC is affected by seasonal freeze-thaw processes and changes in moisture status, and (2) deeper permafrost and peatland strata down to several tens of meters depth where SOC is usually not affected by short-term changes.

Press disturbances of relatively slow but persistent nature such as top-down thawing of permafrost, and changes in hydrology, microbiological communities, pedological processes, and vegetation types, as well as pulse disturbances of relatively rapid and local nature such as wildfires and thermokarst, could substantially impact SOC stocks.

Conversely, Landsat data are more widely available, but exhibit a weaker relationship with structure under medium to high leaf area conditions. One potentially valuable means of enhancing therelationship between Landsat reflectance and forest structure is to incorporate Landsat spectral trends prior to a date of interest. Because the condition of a forest stand at any point in time is linked to the stand's disturbance history, an approach that directly leverages the temporal information of Landsat time series should improve estimates of forest structure. The main objective of this study was to test and demonstrate the utility of disturbance and recovery metrics derived from spectral profiles of annual Landsat time series {LTS) to predict current forest structure attributes (as compared to more traditional approaches, including airborne, discrete return lidar and single-date Landsat). We estimated aboveground live biomass {AGBuve). dead woody biomass {AGBdead). basal area (live and dead). and Lorey's mean stand height for a mixed-conifer forest in eastern Oregon, USA. and compared the results with estimates from lidar and single. current-date Landsat imagery. Annual timeseries stacks for the entire Landsat record (1972-201 0) were obtained to characterize all long-term (insect, growth) and short-term (fire. harvest) vegetation changes that occurred during that period. This required the additional objective of integrating Landsat data from MSS and TM/ETM +sensors. and we describe here our approach.

Because fungal biomass is high in these soils, particularly in areas colonized by rhizomorphic ectomycorrhizal fungal mats, organic matter derived from chitinous cell wall material (or the monomeric building block of chitin, N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)) could be a significant source of C or N to the soil microbiota, and thus an important driver of microbial C and N processing. This paper reports the results of incubation experiments initiated to measure chitin degradation, NAG utilization, and the contribution of these substrates to soil respiration and N mineralization rates in mat-colonized and non-mat soil organic horizons. Amendments of chitin and NAG stimulated respiration, N mineralization, and biomass accumulation in mat and non-mat soils, and responses to NAG amendment were stronger than to chitin amendment. NAG-induced respiration was consistently two-fold higher in mat soils than non-mat soils, but induced N mineralization was similar between the two soil patch types. Assimilation of both C and N into microbial biomass was apparent, biomass C:N ratio decreased in all treatments, and microbial N use efficiency (treatment means 0.25 ± 0.06–0.50 ± 0.05) was greater than C use efficiency (treatment means 0.12 ± 0.04–0.32 ± 0.02). NAGase enzyme response was non-linear and showed the same pattern in chitin and NAG amendments. Responses to NAG and chitin amendment differed between mat and nonmat soils, indicating different mechanisms driving NAG and chitin utilization or differences in saprotrophic community composition between the two soil patch types. Net chitin and NAG processing rates were 0.08–3.4 times the basal respiration rates and 0.07–14 times the ambient net N mineralization rates, high enough for the turnover of total soil amino sugars to potentially occur in days to weeks. The results support the hypotheses that amino sugars are important microbial C and N sources and drivers of C and N cycling in these soils.","2013-03","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-14 16:13:17","2019-05-13 23:12:46","679-693","","1-3","112","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\V5Y6F4BP\Zeglin et al. - 2013 - The importance of amino sugar turnover to C and N .pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the boreal region, recent warming has promoted changes in the fire regime, which may exacerbate rates of permafrost thaw and alter soil OC dynamics in both organic and mineral soil. We examined how interactions between fire and permafrost govern rates of soil OC accumulation in organic horizons, mineral soil of the active layer, and near-surface permafrost in a black spruce ecosystem of interior Alaska. To estimate OC accumulation rates, we used chronosequence, radiocarbon, and modeling approaches. We also developed a simple model to track long-term changes in soil OC stocks over past fire cycles and to evaluate the response of OC stocks to future changes in the fire regime. Our chronosequence and radiocarbon data indicate that OC turnover varies with soil depth, with fastest turnover occurring in shallow organic horizons (60 years) and slowest turnover in near­ surface permafrost (>3000 years). Modeling analysis indicates that OC accumulation in organic horizons was strongly governed by carbon losses via combustion and burial of charred remains in deep organic horizons. OC accumulation in mineral soil was influenced by active layer depth, which determined the proportion of mineral OC in a thawed or frozen state and thus, determined loss rates via decomposition. Our model results suggest that future changes in fire regime will result in substantial reductions in OC stocks, largely from the deep organic horizon. Additional OC losses will result from fire-induced thawing of near-surface permafrost. From these findings, we conclude that the vulnerability of deep OC stocks to future warming is closely linked to the sensitivity of permafrost to wildfire disturbance.","2011-03","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-08 17:05:40","2019-05-13 23:12:23","1461-1474","","3","17","","","The effect of fire and permafrost interactions on soil carbon accumulation in an upland black spruce ecosystem of interior Alaska","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\MPHJNA9V\O'Donnell et al. - 2011 - The effect of fire and permafrost interactions on .pdf","","Fire; Pools; Journal Article; Alaska; Soil; Perfmafrost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explored relationships between materials across depths and at three scales - point, block and site - and examined the data to quantify the degree of spatial clustering. Mass of roots and organic matter declined with depth; there were no consistent patterns with depth for mineral fragments. Correlations between values at the same point but at different depths were low for roots and organic matter at all sites (mean r values < 0.3). Total soil carbon per site was negatively correlated (r = –0.85) with total root mass; correlations between other site or tree variables and below-ground materials were much lower (r = –0.21 to 0.34). There were no detectable spatial patterns in root mass. The number of samples needed to estimate mean root mass was calculated by site and for several desired precision levels; this power analysis will aid others working at similar sites in determining necessary sample sizes a priori, or conversely, in estimating level of precision given a particular sample size.

The former states that treeline trees have an unfavorable carbon balance and cannot support growth of the magnitude observed at lower elevations or latitudes, while the latter argues that treeline trees have an adequate carbon supply, but that cold temperatures directly limit growth. In this study, we examined the relative importance of source and sink limitation in forest and treeline white spruce (Picea glauca) in three mountain ranges from southern to northern Alaska. We related seasonal changes in needle nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) content with branch extension growth, an approach we argue is more powerful than using needle NSC concentration. Branch extension growth in the southernmost Chugach Mountains was much greater than in the White Mountains and the Brooks Range. Trees in the Chugach Mountains showed a greater seasonal decline in needle NSC content than trees in the other mountain ranges, and the seasonal change in NSC was correlated with site-level branch growth across mountain ranges. There was no evidence of a consistent difference in branch growth between the forest and treeline sites, which differ in elevation by approximately 100 m.

Seasonal DOM slug additions were conducted in three headwater streams draining a bog, forested wetland, and upland forest using DOM collected by leaching watershed soils.

There was no significant difference in the uptake of DOC and DON across the soil leachate additions (P > 0.05), although differential uptake of DOM fractions was observed as protein-like fluorescence was removed from the water column more efficiently than bulk DOC and DON (P < 0.05). Moreover, PARAFAC analysis of DOM fluorescence showed that protein like fluorescence decreased downstream during all DOM additions, whereas humic-like fluorescence did not change. This differential processing in added DOM suggests slow and fast turnover pools exist for aquatic DOM. Taken together, our findings argue that DON could potentially fill a larger role in satisfying biotic N demand in oligotrophic headwater streams than previously thought.","2009-08","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-06 18:06:49","2019-05-13 23:13:20","747-759","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ZHJ82UWH\Fellman et al. - 2009 - Uptake of Allochthonous Dissolved Organic Matter f.pdf","","Journal Article; Alaska; Soil; Aquatic; DOC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sites represent Douglas-fir forest ecosystems at two contrasting successional stages: old-growth (OG) and early seral (ES). Here we present eddy flux and meteorological data from two early seral stands and the Wind River AmeriFIux old-growth forest during the growing season (March- October) in 2006 and 2007. We show an alternative approach to the usual friction velocity (u-) method for determining periods of adequate atmospheric boundary layer mixing based on the ratio of mean horizontal (U) or vertical (w) wind flow to a modified turbulent kinetic energy scale (UTKE). This new parameter in addition to footprint modeling showed that daytime CO2 fluxes (FNEE) in small dear-cuts (<10 ha ) can be measured accurately with EC if micrometeorological conditions are carefully evaluated. Peak midday CO2 fluxes (FNEE = -14.0 to -12.3 umol m-2 S -1 ) at OG were measured in April in both 2006 and 2007 before bud break when air and soil temperatures and vapor pressure deficit were relatively low, and soil moisture and light levels were favorable for photosynthesis. At the early seral stands, peak midday CO2 fluxes (FNEE = -11.0 to -8.7 umol m-2 5-1) were measured in June and July while spring-time CO2 fluxes were much smaller (FNEE = -3.8 to -3.6 umol m-2 S-I). Overall, we measured lower evapotranspiration (OG = 230 mm, ES= 297 mm), higher midday FNEE (OG FNEE = -9.0 umol m-2 S -.1, ES FNEE = -7.3 umol m-2 S -I ) and higher Bowen ratios (OGB = 2.0, ESB = 1.2) at the old-growth forest than at the ES sites during the summer months (May-August).

Lawson (PIPO) and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco (PSME) from climates with contrasting precipitation and temperature regimes. Thermotolerance of detached needles was evaluated using chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (FV/FM, FO) and electrolyte leakage. PSME was more heat tolerant than PIPO according to both independent assessments of thermotolerance. Following exposure of whole seedlings to a simulated heat wave at 45 °C for 1 h in a growth chamber, we monitored FV/FM, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) and carbon isotope ratios (delta13C) for 14 days. Heat treatment induced signiﬁcant reductions in FV/FM in both species and a transient reduction in photosynthetic gas exchange only in PIPO 1 day after treatment. Heat treatment induced an increase in glucose + fructose concurrent with a decrease in starch in both species, whereas total NSC and sucrose were not aﬀected by heat treatment. The negative relationship between glucose + fructose and starch observed in treated plants may be due to the conversion of starch to glucose + fructose to aid recovery from heat-induced damage. Populations from drier sites displayed greater delta13C values than those from wetter sites, consistent with higher intrinsic water-use eﬃciency and drought resistance of populations from drier climates. Thermotolerance and heat stress responses appeared to be phenotypically plastic and representative of the environment in which plants were grown, whereas intrinsic water-use eﬃciency appeared to reﬂect ecotypic diﬀerentiation and the climate of origin.","2016-12-21","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-03-04 18:31:03","2019-05-13 23:13:01","301-315","","","37","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\JSWH2D54\Marias et al. - 2016 - Thermotolerance and heat stress responses of Dougl.pdf","","Journal Article; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess the impact of permafrost thaw on soil organic carbon (OC) dynamics, we measured soil hydrologic and thermal dynamics and soil OC stocks across a collapse-scar bog chronosequence in interior Alaska. We observed dramatic changes in the distribution of soil water associated with thawing of ice-rich frozen peat. The impoundment of warm water in collapse-scar bogs initiated talik formation and the lateral expansion of bogs over time. On average, Permafrost Plateaus stored 137 ± 37 kg C m-2 , whereas OC storage in Young Bogs and Old Bogs averaged 84 ± l3 kg C m-2 . Based on our reconstructions, the accumulation of OC in near-surface bog peat continued for nearly 1,000 years following permafrost thaw, at which point accumulation rates slowed. Rapid decomposition of thawed forest peat reduced deep OC stocks by nearly half during the first 100 years following thaw. Using a simple mass-balance model, we show that accumulation rates at the bog surface were not sufficient to balance deep OC losses, resulting in a net loss of OC from the entire peat column. An uncertainty analysis also revealed that the magnitude and timing of soil OC loss from thawed forest peat depends substantially on variation in OC input rates to bog peat and variation in decay constants for shallow and deep OC stocks. These findings suggest that permafrost thaw and the subsequent release of OC from thawed peat will likely reduce the strength of northern permafrost- affected peatlands as a carbon dioxide sink, and consequently, will likely accelerate rates of atmospheric warming.","2012","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 23:31:05","","213-229","","","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8UAUUENU\O'Donnell et al. - 2012 - The Effects of Permafrost Thaw on Soil Hydrologic,.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Soil; Perfmafrost; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In moist acidic tundra (MAT) soils on the North Slope of the Brooks Range, Alaska, substantial losses of C and N were previously observed after long-term nutrient additions. To analyse the role of microbial communities in these losses, we utilized 16S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing coupled with community-level physiological profiling to describe changes in MAT bacterial communities after short and long-term nutrient fertilization in four sets of paired control and fertilized MAT soil samples. Bacterial diversity was lower in long-term fertilized plots. The Acidobacteria were one of the most abundant phyla in all soils and distinct differences were noted in the distributions of Acidobacteria subgroups between mineral and organic soil layers that were also affected by fertilization. In addition, Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria were more abundant in long term fertilized samples compared with control soils. The dramatic increase in sequences within the Gammaproteobacteria identified as Dyella spp. (order Xanthomonadales) in the long-term fertilized samples was confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in several samples. Long-term fertilization was also correlated with shifts in the utilization of specific substrates by microbes present in the soils. The combined data indicate that long-term fertilization resulted in a significant change in microbial community structure and function linked to changes in carbon and nitrogen availability and shifts in above-ground plant communities.","2010-03-07","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-05 17:50:08","2019-05-13 23:12:28","1842-1854","","7","12","","","The effect of nutrient deposition on bacterial communities in Arctic tundra soil","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\W5Y5RLVI\Campbell et al. - 2010 - The effect of nutrient deposition on bacterial com.pdf","","Journal Article; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most current climate-carbon cycle models that include the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle are based on a model developed 40 years ago by Woodwell & Whittaker (1968) and omit advances in biogeochemical understanding since that time. Their model treats net C emissions from ecosystems as the balance between net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (HR, i.e. primarily decomposition).  2. Under conditions near steady state, geographic patterns of decomposition closely match those of NPP, and net C emissions are adequately described as a simple balance of NPP and HR (the Woodwell-Whittaker model). This close coupling between NPP and HR occurs largely because of tight coupling between C and N (nitrogen) cycles and because NPP constrains the food available to heterotrophs.  3. Processes in addition to NPP and HR become important to understanding net C emissions from ecosystems under conditions of rapid changes in climate, hydrology, atmospheric CO2, land cover, species composition and/or N deposition. Inclusion of these processes in climate-C cycle models would improve their capacity to simulate recent and future climatic change.  4. Processes that appear critical to soil C dynamics but warrant further research before incorporation into ecosystem models include below-ground C flux and its partitioning among roots, mycorrhizas and exudates; microbial community effects on C sequestration; and the effects of temperature and labile C on decomposition. The controls over and consequences of these processes are still unclear at the ecosystem scale.  5. Carbon fluxes in addition to NPP and HR exert strong influences over the climate system under conditions of rapid change. These fluxes include methane release, wildfire, and lateral transfers of food and fibre among ecosystems.  6. Water and energy exchanges are important complements to C cycle feedbacks to the climate system, particularly under non-steady-state conditions. An integrated understanding of multiple ecosystem-climate feedbacks provides a strong foundation for policies to mitigate climate change.  7. Synthesis. Current climate systems models that include only NPP and HR are inadequate under conditions of rapid change. Many of the recent advances in biogeochemical understanding are sufficiently mature to substantially improve representation of ecosystem C dynamics in these models","2009-09","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-05 18:36:25","2019-05-13 23:12:04","840-850","","5","97","","","The changing global carbon cycle","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\9PIMTK4L\Chapin III et al. - 2009 - The changing global carbon cycle linking plant-so.pdf","","Carbon Cycle; Journal Article; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies indicate that the northern cryosphere has been not only a substantial sink for atmospheric CO2 in recent decades, but also an important source of CH4 because of emissions from wetlands and lakes. Analyses suggest that the sensitivity of the carbon cycle of the region over the 21 st Century is potentially large, but highly uncertain because numerous pathways of response will be affected by warming. Further research should focus on sensitive elements of the carbon cycle such as the consequences of increased fire disturbance, permafrost degradation, and sea ice loss in the northern cryosphere region drains into the Arctic Ocean. Vast amounts of organic carbon are stored within permafrost and in methane hydrates beneath both subterranean and submerged permafrost.

Climate change is likely to increase forest growth in some regions via CO2 fertilization, increased temperatures, and altered precipitation; however, altered disturbance regimes and climate stress (e.g. drought) will act to reduce carbon stocks in forests as well. Observations of asynchrony in forest change is useful in determining current trends in forest carbon stocks, both in terms of forest density (e.g. Mg ha -1) and spatially (extent and location). Monitoring change in natural (unmanaged) areas is particularly useful, as while afforestation and recovery from historic land use are currently large carbon sinks, the long-term viability of those sinks depends on climate change and disturbance dynamics at their particular location. We utilize a large, unmanaged biome (>135 000 km2) which spans a broad latitudinal gradient to explore how variation in location affects forest density and spatial patterning: the forests of the North American temperate rainforests in Alaska, which store >2.8 Pg C in biomass and soil, equivalent to >8% of the C in contiguous US forests. We demonstrate that the regional biome is shifting; gains exceed losses and are located in different spatio-topographic contexts. Forest gains are concentrated on northerly aspects, lower elevations, and higher latitudes, especially in sheltered areas, whereas loss is skewed toward southerly aspects and lower latitudes. Repeat plot-scale biomass data (n = 759) indicate that within-forest biomass gains outpace losses (live trees >12.7 cm diameter, 986 Gg yr -1) on gentler slopes and in higher latitudes. This work demonstrates that while temperate rainforest dynamics occur at ﬁne spatial scales (<1000 m2), the net result of thousands of individual events is regionally patterned change. Correlations between the disturbance/establishment imbalance and biomass accumulation suggest the potential for relatively rapid biome shifts and biomass changes.","2015-09","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-02-20 01:14:42","2019-05-13 23:11:34","3445-3454","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\B6MQQP87\Buma and Barrett - 2015 - Spatial and topographic trends in forest expansion.pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; Alaska; Growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We review the published literature to examine how family forest owners' values, ecological knowledge, risk perceptions, and forest management and policy preferences may affect their interest in managing for carbon sequestration. We find that although family forest owners may not be particularly motivated to mitigate climate change, their forest management values and practices compliment many carbon-oriented management strategies. However, the strong value owners place on privacy and autonomy, and the weak importance many place on financial reward, may inhibit participation in policies and programs that incentivize carbon oriented management. These findings also have implications for policy efforts to encourage management for other ecological values besides carbon sequestration on family forest lands.","2010","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-06 18:36:11","2019-05-13 23:11:11","1-14","","","2010","","","Social and Cultural Influences on Management for Carbon Sequestration on US Family Forestlands","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\JSUSUXZP\Fischer and Charnley - 2010 - Social and Cultural Influences on Management for C.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Sequestration; Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explored the effects of the stomata-blocking and defoliating fungal disease called Swiss needle cast on Douglas-fir carbohydrate reserves and growth to evaluate the extent to which NSCs can be mobilized under natural conditions of low water stress and restricted carbon supply in relation to potential demands for growth. We analyzed the concentrations of starch, sucrose, glucose and fructose in foliage, twig wood and trunk sapwood of 15 co-occurring Douglas-fir trees expressing a gradient of Swiss needle cast symptom severity quantified as previous-year func¬tional foliage mass. Growth (mean basal area increment, BAI) decreased by ~80% and trunk NSC concentration decreased by 60% with decreasing functional foliage mass. The ratio of relative changes in NSC concentration and BAI, an index of the relative priority of storage versus growth, more than doubled with increasing disease severity. In contrast, twig and foliage NSC concentrations remained nearly constant with decreasing functional foliage mass. These results suggest that under disease-induced reductions in carbon supply, Douglas-fir trees retain NSCs (either actively or due to sequestration) at the expense of trunk radial growth. The crown retains the highest concentrations of NSC, presumably to maintain foliage growth and shoot extension in the spring, partially compensating for rapid foliage loss in the summer and fall.","2014-03-01","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-08 19:51:20","2019-05-13 23:10:45","218-228","","3","34","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\B2T2NCU7\Saffell et al. - 2014 - Seasonal carbohydrate dynamics and growth in Dougl.pdf","","Journal Article; Growth; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Physiological changes at both the leaf and whole plant level have the potential to explain ignition and ﬁre behavior phenomena in live fuels that have been poorly explained for decades.

The study of epiphytes could improve understanding of biological responses to climatic changes, but only if the conditions that elicit physiological performance changes are clearly defined.  METHODS: We evaluated individual growth performance of the epiphytic lichen Evernia mesomorpha, an iconic boreal forest indicator species, in the first year of a decade-long experiment featuring whole-ecosystem warming and drying. Field experimental enclosures were located near the southern edge of the species’ range.  KEY RESULTS: Mean annual biomass growth of Evernia significantly declined 6 percentage points for every +1°C of experimental warming after accounting for interactions with atmospheric drying. Mean annual biomass growth was 14% in ambient treatments, 2% in unheated control treatments, and -9% to -19% (decreases) in energy-added treatments ranging from +2.25 to +9.00°C above ambient temperatures. Warming-induced biomass losses among persistent individuals were suggestive evidence of an extinction debt that could precede further local mortality events.  CONCLUSIONS: Changing patterns of warming and drying would decrease or reverse Evernia growth at its southern range margins, with potential consequences for the maintenance of local and regional populations. Negative carbon balances among persisting individuals could physiologically commit these epiphytes to local extinction. Our findings illuminate the processes underlying local extinctions of epiphytes and suggest broader consequences for range shrinkage if dispersal and recruitment rates cannot keep pace.","2018-02","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-03-03 20:13:30","2019-05-13 23:09:26","266-274","","2","105","","","Novel climates reverse carbon uptake of atmospherically dependent epiphytes","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\RRY9B55Z\Smith et al. - 2018 - Novel climates reverse carbon uptake of atmospheri.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Boreal; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

WFEIS improves access to data and provides a consistent approach to estimating emissions at landscape, regional, and continental scales. The system taps into data and tools developed by the U.S. Forest Service to describe fuels, fuel loadings, and fuel consumption and merges information from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration on fire location and timing. Currently, WFEIS provides web access to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burned area for North America and U.S. fire-perimeter maps from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity products from the USGS, overlays them on 1-km fuel maps for the United States, and calculates fuel consumption and emissions with an open-source version of the Consume model. Mapped fuel moisture is derived from daily meteorological data from remote automated weather stations. In addition to tabular output results, WFEIS produces multiple vector and raster formats. This paper provides an overview of the WFEIS system, including the web-based system functionality and datasets used for emissions estimates. WFEIS operates on the web and is built using open-source software components that work with open international standards such as keyhole markup language (KML).

A comparison of methods to estimate the loss of carbon from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere from wildland fires is presented. Published studies on emissions from recent and historic time periods and five specific cases are summarized, and new emissions estimates are made using contemporary methods for a set of specific fire events. Results from as many as six terrestrial models are compared. We find that methods generally produce similar results within each case, but estimates vary based on site location, vegetation (fuel) type, and fire weather. Area normalized emissions range from 0.23 kg C m -2 for shrubland sites in southern California / NW Mexico to as high as 6.0 kg C m-2 in northern conifer forests. Total emissions range from 0.23 to 1.6 Tg C for a set of 2003 fires in chaparral-dominated landscapes of California to 3.9 to 6.2 Tg C in the dense conifer forests of western Oregon. While the results from models do not always agree, variations can be attributed to differences in model assumptions and methods, including the treatment of canopy consumption and methods to account for changes in fuel moisture, one of the main drivers of variability in fire emissions.

As the climate warms this vast and frozen C pool is at risk of being thawed, decomposed, and released to the atmosphere as greenhouse gasses. At the same time, some C losses may be offset by warming-mediated increases in plant productivity. Plant and microbial responses to warming ultimately determine net C exchange from ecosystems, but the timing and magnitude of these responses remain uncertain. Here we show that experimental warming and permafrost (ground that remains below 08C for two or more consecutive years) degradation led to a two-fold increase in net ecosystem C uptake during the growing season. However, warming also enhanced winter respiration, which entirely offset growing-season C gains. Winter C losses may be even higher in response to actual climate warming than to our experimental manipulations, and, in that scenario, could be expected to more than double overall net C losses from tundra to the atmosphere. Our results highlight the importance of winter processes in determining whether tundra acts as a C source or sink, and demonstrate the potential magnitude of C release from the permafrost zone that might be expected in a warmer climate.","2014-03","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 22:34:23","2019-05-13 23:09:49","602-608","","3","95","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\PKYDSWRX\Natali et al. - 2014 - Permafrost degradation stimulates carbon loss from.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Soil; Perfmafrost; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adsorptive mechanisms were further separated into interactions involving (1) specific clay minerals, (2) amorphous solid phases of hydrous aluminum and iron oxides, and (3) fine particulate organic matter. Physical-chemical adsorptive mechanisms for alder leachate removal exhibited rapid kinetic equilibration between the DOC and solid phases, but only a specific fraction of the DOC, likely containing certain chemical functional groups, was adsorbed. The amorphous aluminum and iron oxides possessed a much higher potential capacity than the clay minerals or fine particulate organics for DOC adsorption.

However, microbial activity was overall much more effective in the removal and degradation of the total DOC pool leached from alder leaves.

In this study, we link forest inventory data to remote sensing data to derive estimates of pre- and post-disturbance biomass, and then use near-annual remote sensing observations of forest disturbance to characterize biomass loss associated with disturbance across the conterminous U.S. between 1986 and 2004. Nationally, year-to-year variability in the amount of live aboveground carbon lost as a result of disturbance ranged from a low of 61 Tg C (±16) in 1991 to a high of 84 Tg C (±33) in 2003. Eastern and western forest strata were relatively balanced in terms of their proportional contribution to national-level trends, despite eastern forests having more than twice the area of western forests. In the eastern forest stratum, annual biomass loss tracked closely with the area of disturbance, whereas in the western forest stratum, annual biomass loss showed more year-to-year variability that did not directly correspond to the area of disturbance, suggesting that the biomass density of forests affected by disturbance in the west was more spatially and temporally variable. Eastern and western forest strata exhibited somewhat opposing trends in biomass loss, potentially corresponding to the implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan in the mid 1990s that resulted in a shift of timber harvesting from public lands in the northwest to private lands in the south. Overall, these observations document modest increases in disturbance rates and associated carbon consequences over the 18-year period. These changes are likely not significant enough to weaken a growing forest carbon sink in the conterminous U.S. based largely on increased forest growth rates and biomass densities.","2014-01","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-08 18:31:54","2019-05-13 23:09:35","142-157","","1","17","","","Observation of Trends in Biomass Loss as a Result of Disturbance in the Conterminous U.S.","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\V9L8JXQJ\Powell et al. - 2014 - Observation of Trends in Biomass Loss as a Result .pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; Flux; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We collected tree cores from white spruce trees growing on steep, south-facing river bluffs at ﬁve sites in interior Alaska, and analyzed the relationship between ring widths and climate using boosted regression trees. Precipitation and temperature of the previous growing season are important controls over growth at most sites: trees grow best in the coolest, wettest years. We identify clear thresholds in growth response to a number of variables, including both temperature and precipitation variables. General circulation model (GCM) projections of future climate in this region suggest that optimum climatic conditions for white spruce growth will become increasingly rare in the future.

The objective of reducing global greenhouse gases (GHG) requires increasing carbon storage in pools other than the atmosphere. Growing more forests and keeping forests as forests are only part of the solution, because focusing solely on the sequestration benefits of the forests misses the important (and substantial) carbon storage and substitution GHG benefits of harvested forest products, as well as other benefits of active forest management. Forests and global climate are closely linked in terms of carbon storage and releases, water fluxes from the soil and into the atmosphere, and solar energy capture. Understanding how carbon dynamics are affected by stand age, density, and management and will evolve with climate change is fundamental to exploiting the capacity for sustainably managed forests to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. For example, even though temperate forests continue to be carbon sinks, in western North America forest· fires and tree mortality from insects are converting some forests into net carbon sources. Expanding forest biomass use for biofuels and energy generation will compete with traditional forest products, but it may also produce benefits through competition and market efficiency. Short-rotation woody crops, as well as landowners' preferences-based on investment-return expectations and environmental considerations, both of which will be affected by energy and environmental policies -have the potential 10 increase biomass supply. Unlike metals, concrete, and plastic, forest products store atmospheric carbon and have low embodied energy (the amount of energy it takes to make products), so there is a substitution effect when wood is used in place of other building materials. Wood used for energy production also provides substitution benefits by reducing the flow of fossil fuel-based carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The value of carbon credits generated by forest carbon offset projects differs dramatically, depending on the sets of carbon pools allowed by the protocol and baseline employed. The costs associated with establishing and maintaining offset projects depend largely on the protocols' specifics. Measurement challenges and relatively high transaction costs needed for forest carbon offsets warrant consideration of other policies that promote climate benefits from forests and forest products but do not require project-specific accounting. Policies can foster changes in forest management and product manufacture that reduce carbon emissions over time while maintaining forests for environmental and societal benefits. US policymakers should take to heart the finding of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Fourth Assessment Report when it concluded that “ln the long term, a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber, fibre, or energy from the forest, will generate the largest sustained mitigation benefit."" A rational energy and environmental policy framework must be based on the premise that atmospheric greenhouse gas levels are increasing primarily because of the addition of geologic fossil fuel-based carbon into the carbon cycle. Forest carbon policy that builds on the scientific information summarized in this article can be a significant and important part of a comprehensive energy policy that provides for energy independence and carbon benefits while simultaneously providing dean water, wildlife habitat, recreation, and other uses and values.","2011-10","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 18:49:22","","45","","7S","109","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\7B5CF5SB\Malmsheimer et al. - 2011 - Managing Forests Because Carbon Matters Integrati.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Wood products; Economics; Policy; Fuel wood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Carbon-oriented management of forests also offers forest owners an opportunity to obtain a new source of income, and commonly has environmental co-benefits. The USA is developing climate change policy that recognizes forestry as a source of offsets in carbon markets, and the emissions trading programs and standards that have developed to date offer opportunities for afforestation, reforestation, reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and improved forest management projects. Private forest owners are key players in carbon markets because they own over half of the forest land in the USA and carbon offsetting from public forest land is rare. However, a number of environmental, economic, and social constraints currently limit carbon market participation by forest owners. Key issues include: the low price of carbon and high cost of market entry; whether small landowners can gain market access; how to meet requirements such as management plans and certification; and whether managing for carbon is consistent with other forest management goals.

The response of northern tundra plant communities to warming temperatures is of critical concern because permafrost ecosystems play a key role in global carbon (C) storage, and climate induced ecological shifts in the plant community will affect the transfer of carbon-dioxide between biological and atmospheric pools.  2. This study, which focuses on the response of tundra plant growth and phenology to experimental warming, was conducted at the Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research project, located in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range. We used snow fences coupled with spring snow removal to increase deep-soil temperatures and thaw depth (winter warming), and open-top chambers to increase summer air temperatures (summer warming).  3. Winter warming increased wintertime soil temperature (5-40 cm) by 2.3 °C, resulting in a 10% increase in growing season thaw depth. Summer warming significantly increased growing season air temperature; peak temperature differences occurred near midday when summer warming plots were approximately 1.0 °C warmer than ambient plots.  4. Changes in the soil environment as a result of winter warming treatment resulted in a 20% increase in above-ground biomass and net primary productivity (ANPP), while there was no detected summer warming effect on ecosystem-level ANPP or biomass. Both summer and winter warming extended the growing season through earlier bud break and delayed senescence, despite equivalent snow-free days across treatments. As with ANPP, winter warming increased canopy N mass by 20%, while there was no summer warming effect on canopy N.  5. The warming-mediated increase in N availability, coupled with phenological shifts, may have driven higher rates of A NPP in the winter warming plots, and the lack of ecosystem-level N and ANPP response to summer warming suggest continued N limitation in the summer warming plots.  6. Synthesis: These results highlight the role of soil and permafrost dynamics in regulating plant response to climate change and provide evidence that warming may promote greater C accumulation in tundra plant biomass. While warming temperatures are expected to enhance microbial decomposition of the large pool of organic matter stored in tundra soils and permafrost, these respiratory losses may be offset, at least in part, by warming-mediated increases in plant growth","2012","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 22:34:23","","488-498","","2","100","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\GRJVQYF7\Natali et al. - 2012 - Increased plant productivity in Alaskan tundra as .pdf","","Journal Article; Alaska; Soil; Growth; Perfmafrost; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To understand future responses of permafrost soils to climate change, we inventoried current soil C stocks, investigated DELTA- 14C, C:N, delta-C, and delta-N depth profiles, modeled soil C accumulation rates, and calculated decadal net ecosystem production (NEP) in subarctic tundra soils undergoing minimal, moderate, and extensive permafrost thaw near Eight Mile Lake (EML) in Healy, Alaska. We modeled decadal and millennial soil C inputs, decomposition constants, and C accumulation rates by plotting cumulative C inventories against C ages based on radiocarbon dating of surface and deep soils, respectively. Soil C stocks at EML were substantial, over 50 kg C m-2 in- the top meter, and did not differ much among sites. Carbon to nitrogen ratio, delta- 13C, and delta- 15N depth profiles indicated most of the decomposition occurred within the organic soil horizon and practically ceased in deeper, frozen horizons. The average C accumulation rate for EML surface soils was 25.8 g C m-2 y- 1 and the rate for the deep soil accumulation was 2.3 g C m-2 y- 1 , indicating these systems have been C sinks throughout the Holocene. Decadal net ecosystem production averaged 14.4 g C m-2 y- 1 . However, the shape of decadal C accumulation curves, combined with recent annual NEP measurements, indicates soil C accumulation has halted and the ecosystem may be becoming a C source.

However, comparatively little attention has been given to their role as labile carbon (C) substrates that might influence the metabolic status of resident microbial populations. We hypothesized that the residence time of simple C substrates, such as FAA, are mechanistically linked to the turnover of endogenous soil C pools. We tested this hypothesis across a latitudinal gradient of forested ecosystems that differ sharply with regard to climate, overstory taxon, and edaphic properties. Using a combined laboratory and field approach, we compared the turnover of isotopically labeled glycine in situ to the turnover of mineralizable soil C (Cmin) at each site. The turnover of glycine was rapid (residence times <2 h) regardless of soil type. However, across all ecosystems glycine turnover rates were strongly correlated with indices of soil organic matter quality. For example, CN ratios for the upper soil horizons explained ~ 80% of the variability observed in glycine turnover, and there was a strong positive correlation between in situ glycine-C turnover and Cmin measured in the laboratory. The turnover of glycine in situ was better explained by changes in soil C availability than cross-ecosystem variation in soil temperature or concentrations of dissolved inorganic N and FAA-N. This suggests the consumption of these low-molecular- weight substrates by soil microorganisms may be governed as much by the overall decomposability of soil C as by N limitation to microbial growth.","2010-07","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 22:40:19","2019-05-13 23:06:51","175-191","","1-3","99","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\UZV2D6VZ\McFarland et al. - 2010 - Glycine mineralization in situ closely correlates .pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Leaf litter breakdown rates are expected to increase as water temperatures rise in response to climate change. The magnitude of increase in breakdown rates is uncertain, given differences in litter quality and microbial and detritivore community responses to temperature, factors that can inﬂuence the apparent temperature sensitivity of breakdown and the relative proportion of C lost to the atmosphere vs. stored or transported downstream. Here, we synthesized 1025 records of litter breakdown in streams and rivers to quantify its temperature sensitivity, as measured by the activation energy (Ea, in eV). Temperature sensitivity of litter breakdown varied among twelve plant genera for which Ea could be calculated. Higher values of Ea were correlated with lower-quality litter, but these correlations were inﬂuenced by a single, N-ﬁxing genus (Alnus). Ea values converged when genera were classiﬁed into three breakdown rate categories, potentially due to continual water availability in streams and rivers modulating the inﬂuence of leaf chemistry on breakdown. Across all data representing 85 plant genera, the Ea was 0.34 Æ 0.04 eV, or approximately half the value (0.65 eV) predicted by metabolic theory. Our results indicate that average breakdown rates may increase by 5–21% with a 1–4 °C rise in water temperature, rather than a 10–45% increase expected, according to metabolic theory. Differential warming of tropical and temperate biomes could result in a similar proportional increase in breakdown rates, despite variation in Ea values for these regions (0.75 Æ 0.13 eV and 0.27 Æ 0.05 eV, respectively). The relative proportions of gaseous C loss and organic matter transport downstream should not change with rising temperature given that Ea values for breakdown mediated by microbes alone and microbes plus detritivores were similar at the global scale.","2017-08","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 19:15:44","2019-05-13 23:06:48","3064-3075","","8","23","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\SSH5YHT7\Follstad Shah et al. - 2017 - Global synthesis of the temperature sensitivity of.pdf; D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\YXGPP9YH\gcb13609-sup-0001-appendixs1.xlsx","","Journal Article; Aquatic; Climate; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This contrasts with previous research, using diameter at breast height rather than at 15 em, which found that separate equations were warranted for trees with and without competing vegetation. Estimated whole-tree biomass among the six site/VC combinations ranged from 0.8 to 7.5 Mg ha-1, and increases in tree biomass associated with VC ranged from 62% to 173% among sites. Among the three sites, there were positive, linear relationships between soil total N content to a depth of 60 cm and both N content of aboveground vegetation (trees plus competing vegetation) and Douglas- fir foliar N concentration. Tree N content increased by 8.4, 8.2, and 40.0 kg N ha-1 with VC at the three sites, whereas competing vegetation N content decreased with VC by 0.9, 18.8, and 32.0 kg N ha-l, respectively, at the same sites. Thus, VC did not lead to a direct compensatory tradeoff between aboveground N content of trees and other vegetation. However, soil N content was linearly related to N accumulation and plant growth across the three sites. In addition to differences in N availability among sites, the effect of VC on the redistribution of resources among trees and competing vegetation also was influenced by vegetation community composition and efficacy of VC treatments.","2011-12","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-05 19:52:46","2019-05-13 23:05:53","2187-2198","","12","262","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QREP3CMN\Devine et al. - 2011 - Five-year vegetation control effects on abovegroun.pdf","","Management; Biomass; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such treatments have the immediate effect of reducing forest carbon stocks but likely reduce future carbon losses through the combustion and mortality caused by high severity wildfires. Assessing the long-term impact of fuel treatment on the carbon balance of fire prone forests has been difficult because of uncertainties regarding treatment and wildfire impacts on any given landscape. In this study we attempt to remove some of the confusion surrounding this subject by performing a sensitivity analysis wherein long-term, landscape wide carbon stocks are simulated under a wide range of treatment efficacy, treatment lifespan, fire impacts, forest recovery rates, forest decay rates, and the longevity of wood products. Our results indicate a surprising insensitivity of long-term carbon stocks to both management and biological variables. After 80 years, a 1600% change in either forest growth or decomposition resulted in only a 40% change in total system carbon, and a 1600% change in either treatment application rate or efficacy in arresting fire spread resulted in only a 10% change in total system carbon. This insensitivity of long-term carbon stocks is due in part by the infrequency of treatment-wildfire interaction and in part by the controls imposed by maximum forest biomass. None of the fuel treatment simulation scenarios resulted in increased system carbon.","2013-05","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-02-16 01:22:49","2019-05-13 23:06:15","124-132","","","121","","","Forest wildfire, fuel reduction treatments, and landscape carbon stocks","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\Q9IU6Z8E\Campbell and Ager - 2013 - Forest wildfire, fuel reduction treatments, and la.pdf","","Fire; Pools; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a combination of field measurements, numerical modeling of soil thermal dynamics, and mass-balance modeling of OC dynamics, we tested the sensitivity of soil OC storage to a suite of individual climate factors (air temperature, soil moisture, and snow depth) and fire severity. We also conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the combined effects of fire-soil moisture interactions and snow seasonality on OC storage. OC losses were calculated as the difference in OC stocks after three fire cycles (~500 yr) following a prescribed step-change in climate and/or fire. Across single-factor scenarios, our findings indicate that warmer air temperatures resulted in the largest relative soil OC losses (~5.3 kg C m-2), whereas dry soil conditions alone (in the absence of wildfire) resulted in the smallest carbon losses (~0.1 kgC m-2). Increased fire severity resulted in carbon loss of ~3.3 kg C m-2, whereas changes in snow depth resulted in smaller OC losses (2.1-2.2 kg C m-2). Across multiple climate factors, we observed larger OC losses than for single-factor scenarios. For instance, high fire severity regime associated with warmer and drier conditions resulted in OC losses of ~6.1 kg C m-2, whereas a low fire severity regime associated with warmer and wetter conditions resulted in OC losses of ~5.6 kgC m-2. A longer snow-free season associated with future warming resulted in OC losses of ~5.4 kg C m-2. Soil climate was the dominant control on soil OC loss, governing the sensitivity of microbial decomposers to fluctuations in temperature and soil moisture; this control, in tum, is governed by interannual changes in active layer depth. Transitional responses of the active layer depth to fire regimes also contributed to OC losses, primarily by determining the proportion of OC into frozen and unfrozen soil layers.","2011","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 23:30:48","","1367-1382","","","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\KSS4P9B5\O'Donnell et al. - 2011 - Exploring the sensitivity of soil carbon dynamics .pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; Processes; Soil; Perfmafrost; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dissolved nitrate, ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus were also collected on 20 July and 09 October 1999. Wells were characterised by their associated overlying vegetation: bare cobble/young alder, mid-aged alder (8-20 years) and old alder/old-growth conifer (25 to >100 years). POM was analysed for the ash-free dry mass and the activities of eight exoenzymes (x-glucosidase, B-glucosidase, B-N-acetylglucosaminidase, xylosidase, phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase, esterase and endopeptidase) using fluorogenic substrates. 3. Exoenzyme activities in the Queets River hyporheic zone indicated the presence of an active microbial community metabolising a diverse array of organic molecules. Individual exoenzyme activity (mean ± standard error) ranged from 0.507 ± 0.1547 to 22.8 ± 5.69 umol MUF (g AFDM)-1 h-1, was highly variable among wells and varied seasonally, with the lowest rates occurring in March. Exoenzyme activities were weakly correlated with DO, DOC and inorganic nutrient concentrations. 4. Ratios of leucine aminopeptidase: B-glucosidase were low in March, May and October and high in July, potentially indicating a switch from polysaccharides to proteins as the dominant component of microbial metabolism. 5. Principal components analysis indicated that there were patch effects and that these effects were strongest in the summer. 6.DOM degradation patterns did not change systematically along hyporheic flowpaths but varied with overlying forest patch type in the Queets River hyporheic zone, suggesting that additional carbon inputs exist. We hypothesise that the most likely input is the downward movement of DOM from overlying riparian soils.

We monitored growing season carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes across a factorial design of in situ water table (control. drought, and flooded plots) and soil warming (control vs. warming via open top chambers) treatments for 2 years in a rich fen located just outside the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest in interior Alaska. The drought (lowered water table position) treatment was a weak sink or small source of atmospheric CO2 compared to the moderate atmospheric CO2 sink at our control. This change in net ecosystem exchange was due to lower gross primary production and light saturated photosynthesis rather than increased ecosystem respiration. The flooded (raised water table position) treatment was a greater CO2 sink in 2006 due largely to increased early season gross primary production and higher light-saturated photosynthesis. Although flooding did not have substantial effects on rates of ecosystem respiration, this water table treatment had lower maximum respiration rates and a higher temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration than the control plot. Surface soil warming increased both ecosystem respiration and gross primary production by approximately 16% compared to control (ambient temperature) plots, with no net effect on net ecosystem exchange.

Increasing mortality rates are associated with rising temperature and vapor pressure deﬁcit, liana abundance, drought, wind events, ﬁre and, possibly, CO2 fertilization-induced increases in stand thinning or acceleration of trees reaching larger, more vulnerable heights. The majority of these mortality drivers may kill trees in part through carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. The relative importance of each driver is unknown. High species diversity may buffer MTFs against large-scale mortality events, but recent and expected trends in mortality drivers give reason for concern regarding increasing mortality within MTFs. Models of tropical tree mortality are advancing the representation of hydraulics, carbon and demography, but require more empirical knowledge regarding the most common drivers and their subsequent mechanisms.

Because of their large size, estimates of biomass and growth of large trees are often based on ground-level measurements (e.g., diameter at breast height, DBH) and little is known about growth dynamics within the crown. As trees increase in size, growth of the crown may not be reﬂected in DBH measurements contributing to inaccuracy of aboveground forest productivity. Here we present data from a 10-yr re-measurement of crown structure and branch/trunk growth of 400-year-old Pseudotsuga menziesii trees in an old-growth forest in western Washington, USA. In six study trees, 40–60% of branches occurred in the upper third of the live crown. Branch mortality over 10 years was highest in the lower third of the crown. Of live-branch mass (including leaf mass), 41–78% occurred in the middle third of the live crown. During the study period, live-branch mass increased in the upper half of the crown and there was little loss due to fragmentation or death. In contrast, increment of live-branch mass was negligible and live-branch mass decreased in the lower half of the crown. On average, 70–99% of the increment of live-branch mass per tree occurred in the upper half of the crown. Core samples taken from various heights indicated that trunks became less tapered with increasing age as a result of greater increments of upper-trunk radius during the most recent 10 years. Increment of livebranch mass contributed 42 and 66% of the whole-tree and upper-crown increments of mass, respectively, and its vertical distribution corresponded to that of leaf mass density. Increments of trunk mass contributed 88% of the lower-crown increment. Growth increments of the crown were not reﬂected in core samples taken at lower heights. Our estimates of trunk, branch, and leaf mass were consistently smaller than those calculated using empirical allometric equations based on tape-wrap measurements of DBH. Moreover, leaf mass decreased in four trees, whereas allometric equations predicted increases. Our results indicate that large P. menziesii trees can sustain wood mass production, especially in trunk and branches of the upper crown, while leaf mass change can be more dynamic, and that such growth dynamics of the crown are difﬁcult to detect via DBH-based measurements.","2017-01","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 16:30:31","2019-05-13 23:04:04","157-168","","","384","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\NF9UAIKZ\Ishii et al. - 2017 - Crown dynamics and wood production of Douglas-fir .pdf","","Journal Article; Growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We estimated the AGB of the North American boreal forest at 21.8 Pg, with relative error of 1.9% based on 256 GLAS orbits (229 086 pulses).

Permafrost thaw and subsequent microbial decomposition of permafrost organic matter could add large amounts of C to the atmosphere, thereby inﬂuencing the global C cycle. The rates at which C is being released from the permafrost zone at different soil depths and across different physiographic regions are poorly understood but crucial in understanding future changes in permafrost C storage with climate change. We assessed the inherent decomposability of C from the permafrost zone by assembling a database of long-term (>1 year) aerobic soil incubations from 121 individual samples from 23 high-latitude ecosystems located across the northern circumpolar permafrost zone. Using a three-pool (i.e., fast, slow and passive) decomposition model, we estimated pool sizes for C fractions with different turnover times and their inherent decomposition rates using a reference temperature of 5 °C. Fast cycling C accounted for less than 5% of all C in both organic and mineral soils whereas the pool size of slow cycling C increased with C : N.

We used hydropedology to quantify the export of DOC from the terrestrial landscape and understand how soil temperature and water table fluctuations regulate DOC losses in the C - rich, perhumid coastal temperate rainforest (PCTR) of Alaska. Land cover in the region is dominated by three major hydropedologic units: poor fen, forested wetland, and upland. We instrumented soils and streams in nine hydropedologic units to quantify DOC fluxes. Stream-water DOC concentrations varied from 5.7 to 16.7 mg C L -1. Mean area-weighted DOC fluxes were 24.8, 29.9, and 10.5 g C m -2 yr -1 from the poor fens, forested wetlands, and uplands, respectively. We found that increased soil temperature and frequent fluctuations of soil water tables promoted the export of large quantities of DOC from poor fen and forested wetland units and relatively high amounts of DOC from upland units.

Researchers have proposed various strategies for stomatal regulation of leaf gas-exchange that include maintaining a constant leaf internal [CO2], ci, a constant drawdown in CO2 (ca - ci), and a constant ci/ca. These strategies can result in drastically different consequences for leaf gas-exchange. The accuracy of Earth systems models depends in part on assumptions about generalizable patterns in leaf gas-exchange responses to varying ca. The concept of optimal stomatal behavior, exemplified by woody plants shifting along a continuum of these strategies, provides a unifying framework for understanding leaf gas-exchange responses to ca. To assess leaf gas-exchange regulation strategies, we analyzed patterns in ci inferred from studies reporting C stable isotope ratios (d13C) or photosynthetic discrimination (delta) in woody angiosperms and gymnosperms that grew across a range of ca spanning at least 100 ppm. Our results suggest that much of the ca-induced changes in ci/ca occurred across ca spanning 200 to 400 ppm. These patterns imply that ca - ci will eventually approach a constant level at high ca because assimilation rates will reach a maximum and stomatal conductance of each species should be constrained to some minimum level. These analyses are not consistent with canalization toward any single strategy, particularly maintaining a constant ci. Rather, the results are consistent with the existence of a broadly conserved pattern of stomatal optimization in woody angiosperms and gymnosperms. This results in trees being profligate water users at low ca, when additional water loss is small for each unit of C gain, and increasingly water-conservative at high ca, when photosystems are saturated and water loss is large for each unit C gain.","2016-02","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-03-03 18:43:53","2019-05-13 23:01:03","889-902","","2","22","","","A dynamic leaf gas-exchange strategy is conserved in woody plants under changing ambient CO <sub>2</sub>","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\UPH4KWRB\Voelker et al. - 2016 - A dynamic leaf gas-exchange strategy is conserved .pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fire has been largely absent from most of this biome since the early Holocene epoch, but its frequency and extent are increasing, probably in response to climate warming. The effect of fires on the C balance of tundra landscapes, however, remains largely unknown. The Anaktuvuk River fire in 2007 burned 1,039 square kilometres of Alaska's Arctic slope, making it the largest fire on record for the tundra biome and doubling the cumulative area burned since 1950. Here we report that tundra ecosystems lost 2,016 ± 435 g C m -2 in the fire, an amount two orders of magnitude larger than annual net C exchange in undisturbed tundra. Sixty per cent of this C loss was from soil organic matter, and radiocarbon dating of residual soil layers revealed that the maximum age of soil C lost was 50 years. Scaled to the entire burned area, the fire released approximately 2.1 teragrams of C to the atmosphere, an amount similar in magnitude to the annual net C sink for the entire Arctic tundra biome averaged over the last quarter of the twentieth century"".

Understanding the response of forest carbon (C) dynamics to increases in fire will help quantify limits on the contribution of forest C storage to climate change mitigation and prioritize forest types for monitoring C storage and fire management to minimize C loss. In this study, we used projections of 21st century area burned to explore the consequences of changes in fire regimes on C dynamics in forests of Washington State. We used a novel empirical approach that takes advantage of chronosequences of C pools and fluxes and statistical properties of fire regimes to explore the effects of shifting age class distributions on C dynamics. Forests of the western Cascades are projected to be more sensitive to climate-driven increases in fire, and thus projected changes in C dynamics, than forests of the eastern Cascades. In the western Cascades, mean live biomass Cis projected to decrease by 24-37%, and coarse woody debris (CWD) biomass C by 15-25% for the 2040s. Loss of live biomass C is projected to be lower for forests of the eastern Cascades and Okanogan Highlands (17-26%), and CWO biomass is projected to increase. Landscape mean net primary productivity is projected to increase in wet low-elevation forests of the western Cascades, but decrease elsewhere. These forests, and moist forests of the Okanogan Highlands, are projected to have the greatest percentage increases in consumption of live biomass. Percentage increases in consumption of CWD biomass are greater than 50% for all regions and up to four times greater than increases in consumption of live biomass. Carbon sequestration in PNW forests will be highly sensitive to increases in fire, suggesting a cautious approach to managing these forests for C sequestration to mitigate anthropogenic C02 emissions.","2012","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-07 19:11:01","","1589-1611","","5","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QN733AUM\Raymond and McKenzie - 2012 - Carbon dynamics of forests in Washington, USA 21s.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Washington; Climate; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined the potential for mixing of different source waters to explain concentrations of DOC and DIC. We did not ﬁnd convincing evidence that either inputs of deep groundwater or lateral inputs of shallow soil water inﬂuenced carbon dynamics. Rather, carbon dynamics appeared to be controlled by local processes in the hyporheic zone and overlying riparian soils. DOC concentrations were low in stream water (0.04–0.09 mM), and decreased with nominal travel time through the hyporheic zone (0.02–0.04 mM lost over 100 h). Conversely, stream water DIC concentrations were much greater than DOC (0.35–0.7 mM) and increased with nominal travel time through the hyporheic zone (0.2–0.4 mM gained over 100 h). DOC in stream water could only account for 10% of the observed increase in DIC. In situ metabolic processing of buried particulate organic matter as well as advection of CO2 from the vadose zone likely accounted for the remaining 90% of the increase in DIC. Overall, the hyporheic zone was a source of DIC to the stream. We suggest that, in mountain stream networks, hyporheic exchange facilitates the transformation of particulate organic carbon buried in ﬂoodplains and transports the DIC that is produced back to the stream where it can be evaded to the atmosphere.","2016-10","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-05 19:06:01","2019-05-13 23:02:42","7556-7576","","10","52","","","Carbon dynamics in the hyporheic zone of a headwater mountain stream in the Cascade Mountains, Oregon","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\SKYFBW3X\Corson-Rikert et al. - 2016 - Carbon dynamics in the hyporheic zone of a headwat.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Aquatic; Oregon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper mechanistically assesses the flushing mechanism of DOC, DONand DINat the hillslope and catchment scale during two storm events, in a small catchment (WS10), H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Using a combination of natural tracer and hydrometric data, and end-member mixing analysis we were able to describe the exact flushing mechanism at the site. This mechanism involved vertical preferential flow to the soil-bedrock interface and then lateral downslope flow, with a finite source of DOC and DONin the organic horizon. Both specific UV absorbance (SUVA,254 nm) and continuously measured raw fluorescence measured with a fluorometer increased during the storm events, suggesting DOC was more aromatic during stormflow compared to baseflow conditions. SUVA patterns in lateral subsurface flow from the hillslope and stream water in combination with hydrometric data enabled us to infer that the contribution of deep soil water and groundwater was higher during the falling limb compared to the rising limb of the hydrograph and contributed to the dilution of DOC, DON and SUVAvalues during storm events. Overall this study showed the value of using a combination of hydrometric data, natural tracer data, and in particular DOCquality indices such as SUVAand fluorescence to mechanistically assess nutrient flushing at the catchment scale. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Forest establishment results in changes in albedo and soil carbon storage, reduced runoff and downstream water supply, and effects on biodiversity. Such effects of forest establishment may be less desirable from environmental, economic and social perspectives. While there have been many studies of the impacts of forest establishment on individual aspects, policy makers need to be able to integrate the benefits and consequences to assist in making decisions on land management. Further, the relative magnitude of the effects of forestry needs to be considered in the context of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide partial pressure and climate change resulting in increasing temperature and changes in the amount and distribution of rainfall. This introductory review highlights the major benefits and consequences of forest establishment and demonstrates progress in integrating across the services provided by forests.

The spatial distribution of turfgrass and its vegetative conditions were mapped with QuickBird satellite imagery. The significant amount of shadows existing in the imagery were detected and removed by taking advantage of the high radiometric resolution of the data. A remote sensing-driven production efficiency model was developed and parameterized with field biophysical measurements to estimate annual net primary production of turfgrass. The results indicated that turfgrass accounted for 38% of land cover in the study area. Turfgrass assimilated 0-1,301 g.C.m(-2).yr(-1) depending on vegetative conditions and management intensity.

The effectiveness of climate mitigation through forest carbon sequestration depends on understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC). Few studies project future LCLUC effects on forest carbon sequestration, and even fewer examine the resulting consequences for forest connectivity and wildlife habitat. First, we asked what forest-relevant climate mitigation strategies have been identified in US state climate mitigation plans, and do they consider implications for wildlife habitat and forest connectivity? Second, for Wisconsin, a partially forested state, what are the effects of three future LCLUC scenarios on afforestation, forest loss, carbon sequestration and storage, forest connectivity, and wildlife habitat? The 35 US states with climate mitigation plans recommended woody biomass for biofuels or energy production (27 states), forest loss prevention (24 states), and afforestation (17 states). Most plans (24 states) anticipated positive wildlife impacts while 7 plans indicated potential negative wildlife impacts from biomass energy; only 3 plans anticipated tradeoffs among afforestation and energy production. A LCLUC model for Wisconsin revealed substantial local variation in potential afforestation and forest loss, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat across LCLUC scenarios that range from no change in current conditions (Static Forest) to maximum afforestation potential (All Forest). Projected increases in forest cover under the Dynamic Forest scenario equated to 0.41 TgC sequestered per year, or 1.3% of Wisconsin's emissions of 33 TgC per year. Potential increases in core forest area and connectivity would increase habitat for 60 forest-associated species of greatest conservation need, but may decrease habitat for 48 grassland-associated species of greatest conservation need.

To address this debate over net carbon stocks, we performed a carbon life-cycle analysis on data from a fuels reduction treatment in a temperate, dry conifer forest in the northern Sierra Nevada of California, USA. The analysis tracks the net ecosystem carbon balance over 50 years for two scenarios (1) fuels reduction treatment combined with bioenergy production, and (2) a baseline scenario of no action. The study includes above and belowground carbon stocks, removals from harvesting, emissions from harvesting and transporting the removed biomass, and disturbance by wildfire. We evaluate a range of fire rotations, from an historic short rotation to a modern long rotation. In this study, when the fire rotation is 31 years or less, fuels treatment and bioenergy result in a net increase in carbon stocks after 50 years compared to a baseline of no action. When fire rotations exceed 31 years the carbon balance shifts and the baseline scenario holds more carbon after 50 years than the fuels treatment. Over the 50-year period, future wildfire is the greatest source of emissions unless fire rotations are greater than 200 years, when emissions from the combustion of biomass for energy are greater. Emissions from mechanical treatments and transportation of the woody biomass are each less than 1% of total emissions. The results of this case study suggest that there is no single answer to whether fuels reduction treatments with bioenergy production create net carbon benefit. Managers will need to evaluate fuels treatments on a case-by-case or regional basis to determine net carbon outcomes. The life cycle approach presented here is a useful methodology for such determinations. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Scenarios featured direct payments to landowners of $0 (baseline), $5, $10, or $15 per metric ton of additional forest carbon sequestered on the set aside lands, with maximum annual expenditures of $3 billion. Results indicated that from 1513 to 6837 Tg (Teragrams) of additional carbon (as carbon dioxide equivalent, CO(2)e) would be sequestered on U.S. timberlands relative to the baseline case over the next 50 years (30-137 Tg CO(2)e annually). These projected amounts of sequestered carbon on timberlands take into account projected increases in timber removal and forest carbon losses on other timberlands (carbon leakage effects). Net effectiveness of carbon reserve scenarios in terms of overall net gain in timberland carbon stocks from 2010 to 2060 ranged from 0.29 tCO(2)e net carbon increase for a payment of $5/tCO(2)e to the landowner (71% leakage), to 0.15 tCO(2)e net carbon increase for a payment of $15/tCO(2)e to the landowner (85% leakage). A policy or program to buy carbon credits from landowners would need to discount additions to the carbon reserve by the estimated amount of leakage. In the scenarios evaluated, the timber set-asides reduced timberland area available for harvest up to 35% and available timber inventory up to 55%, relative to the baseline scenario over the next 50 years, resulting in projected changes in timber prices, harvest levels, and forest product revenues for the forest products sector.","2013","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2021-01-27 17:40:05","","286-306","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000324660000005","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\YJTBDQTB\Nepal et al. - 2013 - Forest carbon benefits, costs and leakage effects .pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Economics; Offset; Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, some mitigation techniques may contrast with management strategies for other goals, such as maintaining and restoring biodiversity. Forest thinning reduces C storage in the overstory and recruitment of detrital C. These C stores can affect environmental conditions and resource availability in the understory, driving patterns in the distribution of early and late-seral species. We examined the effects of replicated (N = 7) thinning experiments on aboveground C and understory vascular plant species richness, and we contrasted relationships between aboveground C and early- vs. late-seral species richness. Finally, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine relationships among early- and late-seral species richness and live and detrital aboveground C stores. Six years following thinning, aboveground C was greater in the high-density treatment and untreated control than in moderate- (MD) and variable-density (VD) treatments as a result of reductions in live overstory C. In contrast, all thinning treatments increased species richness relative to controls. Between the growing seasons of years 6 and 11 following treatments, the live overstory C increment tended to increase with residual density, while richness decreased in MD and VD treatments. The richness of early-seral species was negatively related to aboveground C in MD and VD, while late-seral species richness was positively (albeit weakly) related to aboveground C. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed strong negative effects of live overstory C on early-seral species richness balanced against weaker positive effects on late-seral species richness, as well as positive effects of detrital C stocks. A trade-off between carbon and plant species richness thus emerges as a net result of these relationships among species traits, thinning treatments, and live and detrital C storage. Integrating C storage with traditional conservation objectives may require managing this trade-off within stands and landscapes (e.g., maintain early-seral habitat and species within dense, C-rich forests and, conversely, live and detrital C stores in early-seral habitats) or separating these goals across scales and species groupings.","2013-09","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-05 17:48:30","","1297-1310","","6","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000323935700006","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\JYJI7MH5\Burton et al. - 2013 - Management trade-off between aboveground carbon st.pdf","","Management; Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Oregon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large amounts of carbon (C) are stored in deep mineral forest soils, but are often not considered in accounting for global C fluxes because mineral soil C is commonly thought to be relatively stable. We explore C fluxes associated with forest management practices by examining existing data on forest C fluxes in the northeastern US. Our findings demonstrate that mineral soil C can play an important role in C emissions, especially when considering intensive forest management practices. Such practices are known to cause a high aboveground C flux to the atmosphere, but there is evidence that they can also promote comparably high and long-term belowground C fluxes. If these additional fluxes are widespread in forests, recommendations for increased reliance on forest biomass may need to be reevaluated. Furthermore, existing protocols for the monitoring of forest C often ignore mineral soil C due to lack of data.

This study assessed the biophysical forcings and climatic impact of vegetation replacement across North America by comparing satellite-derived albedo, land surface temperature (LST), and evapotranspiration (ET) between adjacent vegetation types. We calculated radiative forcings (RF) for potential local conversions from croplands (CRO) or grasslands (GRA) to evergreen needleleaf (ENF) or deciduous broadleaf (DBF) forests. Forests generally had lower albedo than adjacent grasslands or croplands, particularly in locations with snow. They also had warmer nighttime LST, cooler daily and daytime LST in warm seasons, and smaller daily LST ranges. Darker forest surfaces induced positive RFs, dampening the cooling effect of carbon sequestration. The mean (+/- SD) albedo-induced RFs for each land conversion were equivalent to carbon emissions of 2.2 +/- 0.7 kg C/m(2) (GRA-ENF), 2.0 +/- 0.6 kg C/m(2) (CRO-ENF), 0.90 +/- 0.50 kg C/m(2) (CRO-DBF), and 0.73 +/- 0.22 kg C/m(2) (GRA-DBF), suggesting that, given the same carbon sequestration potential, a larger net cooling (integrated globally) is expected for planting DBF than ENF. Both changes in LST and ET induce longwave RFs that sometimes had values comparable to or even larger than albedo-induced shortwave RFs. Sensible heat flux, on average, increased when replacing CRO with ENF, but decreased for conversions to DBF, suggesting that DBF tends to cool near-surface air locally while ENF tends to warm it. This local temperature effect showed some seasonal variation and spatial dependence, but did not differ strongly by latitude. Overall, our results show that a carbon-centric accounting is, in many cases, insufficient for climate mitigation policies. Where afforestation or reforestation occurs, however, deciduous broadleaf trees are likely to produce stronger cooling benefits than evergreen needleleaf trees provide.","2014-05","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-14 16:41:58","","329-353","","2","84","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000335859700007","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\YMRNWQMX\Zhao and Jackson - 2014 - Biophysical forcings of land-use changes from pote.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Processes; Land use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, as a result of climate change, disturbance frequency is expected to increase in the future in many regions. It is not yet clear how such changes might affect forest ecosystems, and which mechanisms contribute to (current and future) disturbance resilience. We studied a 6364-ha landscape in the western Cascades of Oregon, USA, to investigate how patches of remnant old-growth trees (as one important class of biological legacies) affect the resilience of forest ecosystems to disturbance. Using the spatially explicit, individual-based, forest landscape model iLand, we analyzed the effect of three different levels of remnant patches (0%, 12%, and 24% of the landscape) on 500-year recovery trajectories after a large, high-severity wildfire. In addition, we evaluated how three different levels of fire frequency modulate the effects of initial legacies. We found that remnant live trees enhanced the recovery of total ecosystem carbon (TEC) stocks after disturbance, increased structural complexity of forest canopies, and facilitated the recolonization of late-seral species (LSS). Legacy effects were most persistent for indicators of species composition (still significant 500 years after disturbance), while TEC (i.e., a measure of ecosystem functioning) was least affected, with no significant differences among legacy scenarios after 236 years. Compounding disturbances were found to dampen legacy effects on all indicators, and higher initial legacy levels resulted in elevated fire severity in the second half of the study period. Overall, disturbance frequency had a stronger effect on ecosystem properties than the initial level of remnant old-growth trees. A doubling of the historically observed fire frequency to a mean fire return interval of 131 years reduced TEC by 10.5% and lowered the presence of LSS on the landscape by 18.1% on average, demonstrating that an increase in disturbance frequency (a potential climate change effect) may considerably alter the structure, composition, and functioning of forest landscapes. Our results indicate that live tree legacies are an important component of disturbance resilience, underlining the potential of retention forestry to address challenges in ecosystem management.","2014-12","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-09 16:49:20","","2063-2077","","8","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000346005400014","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\5K6F74XK\Seidl et al. - 2014 - Disturbance legacies increase the resilience of fo.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

State forestry agencies were surveyed to gather their perspectives on carbon management and carbon market participation, assess current demand for assistance, and identify the types of state-sponsored programs available to landowners. Currently, only a few states have carbon management or carbon market assistance programs. A majority of states report that demand for carbon assistance is low, and few landowners are aware of carbon management or markets. Interestingly, and in contrast to previous estimates, demand and interest often appear unrelated to a state's physical forest sequestration capacity.

The long-term consequences of such intensive harvest are unclear, particularly as forests face novel climatic conditions over the next century. We used a simulation model to project the long-term effects of management and climate change on above- and belowground forest carbon storage in a watershed in northwestern Oregon. The multi-ownership watershed has a diverse range of current management practices, including little-to-no harvesting on federal lands, short-rotation clear-cutting on industrial land, and a mix of practices on private nonindustrial land. We simulated multiple management scenarios, varying the rate and intensity of harvest, combined with projections of climate change. Our simulations project a wide range of total ecosystem carbon storage with varying harvest rate, ranging from a 45% increase to a 16% decrease in carbon compared to current levels. Increasing the intensity of harvest for bioenergy caused a 2-3% decrease in ecosystem carbon relative to conventional harvest practices. Soil carbon was relatively insensitive to harvest rotation and intensity, and accumulated slowly regardless of harvest regime. Climate change reduced carbon accumulation in soil and detrital pools due to increasing heterotrophic respiration, and had small but variable effects on aboveground live carbon and total ecosystem carbon. Overall, we conclude that current levels of ecosystem carbon storage are maintained in part due to substantial portions of the landscape (federal and some private lands) remaining unharvested or lightly managed.Increasing the intensity of harvest for bioenergy on currently harvested land, however,led to a relatively small reduction in the ability of forests to store carbon.

Because drought tolerance varies among species and size of trees, such events can alter the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystem in ways that are difficult to detect with local data sets or solely with remote-sensing platforms. We investigated a widespread tree mortality event that resulted from the worst 1-year drought on record for the state of Texas, USA. The drought affected ecoregions spanning mesic to semiarid climate zones and provided a unique opportunity to test hypotheses related to how trees of varying genus and size were affected. The study was based on an extensive set of 599 distributed plots, each 0.16 ha, surveyed in the summer following the drought. In each plot, dead trees larger than 12.7 cm in diameter were counted, sized, and identified to the genus level. Estimates of total mortality were obtained for each of 10 regions using a combination of design-based estimators and calibrated remote sensing using MODIS 1-yr change in normalized difference vegetation index products developed by the U.S. Forest Service. As compared with most of the publicized extreme die-off events, this study documents relatively low rates of mortality occurring over a very large area. However, statewide, regional tree mortality was massive, with an estimated 6.2% of the live trees perishing, nearly nine times greater than normal annual mortality. Dead tree diameters averaged larger than the live trees for most ecoregions, and this trend was most pronounced in the wetter climate zones, suggesting a potential re-ordering of species dominance and downward trend in tree size that was specific to climatic regions. The net effect on carbon storage was estimated to be a redistribution of 24-30 Tg C from the live tree to dead tree carbon pool. The dead tree survey documented drought mortality in more than 29 genera across all regions, and surprisingly, drought resistant and sensitive species fared similarly in some regions. Both angiosperms and gymnosperms were affected. These results highlight that drought-driven mortality alters forest structure differently across climatic regions and genera.","2016-03","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-07 23:12:14","","602-611","","2","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000374118700022","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QFWJB29X\Moore et al. - 2016 - Tree mortality from an exceptional drought spannin.pdf","","Journal Article; Mortality; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They generally reduce land carbon stocks but also initiate a regrowth legacy that contributes substantially to the contemporary rate of carbon stock increase in US forestlands. As managers and policy makers increasingly look to forests for climate protection and mitigation, and because of increasing concern about changes in disturbance intensity and frequency, there is a need for synthesis and integration of current understanding about the role of disturbances and other processes in governing forest carbon cycle dynamics, and the likely future of this and other sinks for atmospheric carbon. This paper aims to address that need by providing a quantitative review of the distribution, extent and carbon impacts of the major disturbances active in the US. We also review recent trends in disturbances, climate, and other global environmental changes and consider their individual and collective contributions to the US carbon budget now and in the likely future. Lastly, we identify some key challenges and opportunities for future research needed to improve current understanding, advance predictive capabilities, and inform forest management in the face of these pressures. Harvest is found to be the most extensive disturbance both in terms of area and carbon impacts, followed by fire, windthrow and bark beetles, and lastly droughts. Collectively these lead to the gross loss of about 200 Tg C y(-1) in live biomass annually across the conterminous US. At the same time, the net change in forest carbon stocks is positive (190 Tg C y(-1)), indicating not only forest resilience but also an apparently large response to growth enhancements such as fertilization by CO2 and nitrogen. Uncertainty about disturbance legacies, disturbance interactions, likely trends, and global change factors make the future of the US forest carbon sink unclear. While there is scope for management to enhance carbon sinks in US forests, tradeoffs with other values and uses are likely to significantly limit practical implementation. Continued and expanded remote sensing and field-based monitoring capabilities and manipulative experimentation are needed to improve understanding of the US forest carbon sink, and assess how disturbance processes are responding to the pressures of global environmental change. In addition, continued development and application of holistic, decision support tools that consider a range of forest values are needed to enable managers and policy makers to use the best available information for guiding forest resources now and into the future.

The Northwest Forest Plan, adopted two decades ago to guide management on federal lands, is currently being revised as the region searches for a balance between sustainable timber yields and habitat for sensitive species. In addition, climate change imposes a high degree of uncertainty on future forest productivity, sustainability of timber harvest, wildfire risk, and species habitat. We evaluated the long-term, landscape-scale trade-offs among carbon (C) storage, timber yield, and old forest habitat given projected climate change and shifts in forest management policy across 2.1 million hectares of forests in the Oregon Coast Range. Projections highlight the divergence between private and public lands under business-as-usual forest management, where private industrial forests are heavily harvested and many public (especially federal) lands increase C and old forest over time but provide little timber. Three alternative management scenarios altering the amount and type of timber harvest show widely varying levels of ecosystem C and old-forest habitat. On federal lands, ecological forestry practices also allowed a simultaneous increase in old forest and natural early-seral habitat. The ecosystem C implications of shifts away from current practices were large, with current practices retaining up to 105Tg more C than the alternative scenarios by the end of the century. Our results suggest climate change is likely to increase forest productivity by 30-41% and total ecosystem C storage by 11-15% over the next century as warmer winter temperatures allow greater forest productivity in cooler months. These gains in C storage are unlikely to be offset by wildfire under climate change, due to the legacy of management and effective fire suppression. Our scenarios of future conditions can inform policy makers, land managers, and the public about the potential effects of land management alternatives, climate change, and the trade-offs that are inherent to management and policy in the region.","2017","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-05 19:12:36","","503-518","","2","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000395634300015","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\795LLGXF\Creutzburg et al. - 2017 - Forest management scenarios in a changing climate.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Wood products; Oregon; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Acknowledging this, an array of federal regulations and policies have emerged that requires US National Forests to report baseline carbon stocks and changes due to disturbance and management and assess how management activities and forest plans affect carbon stocks. To address these requirements with the best-available science, we compiled empirical and remotely sensed data covering the National Forests (one fifth of the area of US forest land) and analyzed this information using a carbon modeling framework. We demonstrate how integration of various data and models provides a comprehensive evaluation of key drivers of observed carbon trends, for individual National Forests. The models in this framework complement each other with different strengths: the Carbon Calculation Tool uses inventory data to report baseline carbon stocks; the Forest Carbon Management Framework integrates inventory data, disturbance histories, and growth and yield trajectories to report relative effects of disturbances on carbon stocks; and the Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Model incorporates disturbance, climate, and atmospheric data to determine their relative impacts on forest carbon accumulation and loss. We report results for several National Forests across the USA and compare their carbon dynamics. Results show that recent disturbances are causing some forests to transition from carbon sinks to sources, particularly in the West. Meanwhile, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide and nitrogen deposition are consistently increasing carbon stocks, partially offsetting declines due to disturbances and aging. Climate variability introduces concomitant interannual variability in net carbon uptake or release. Targeting forest disturbance and post-disturbance regrowth is critical to management objectives that involve maintaining or enhancing future carbon sequestration.","2017-09","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-06 16:39:13","","207-220","","2","144","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000409001300010","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\L26CZVM8\Dugan et al. - 2017 - Forest sector carbon analyses support land managem.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Wood products; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We chose to use carbon sequestration as the desired future condition because climate change has become a major area of concern during the last decade. Several studies have determined that the 193 million acres of US national forest land currently sequester 11 to 15% of the total carbon emitted as a nation. This paper provides a framework by which national scale strategies for maintaining or enhancing forest carbon sequestration is translated through regional considerations and local constraints in adaptive management practices.

We reviewed global data on changes in soil C following afforestation, available from 43 published or unpublished studies, encompassing 204 sites. Data were highly variable, with soil C either increasing or decreasing, particularly in young (<10-year) forest stands. Because studies varied in the number of years since forest establishment and the initial soil C content, we calculated change in soil C as a weighted-average (i.e. sum of C change divided by sum of years since forest establishment) relative to the soil C content under previous agricultural systems at <10, >10 and <30 cm sampling depths. On average, soil C in the <10 cm (or <30 cm) layers generally decreased by 3.46% per year (or 0.63% per year) relative to the initial soil C content during the first 5 years of afforestation, followed by a decrease in the rate of decline and eventually recovery to C contents found in agricultural soils at about age 30. In plantations older than 30 years, C content was similar to that under the previous agricultural systems within the surface 10 cm of soil, yet at other sampling depths, soil C had increased by between 0.50 and 0.86% per year. Amounts of C lost or gained by soil are generally small compared with accumulation of C in tree biomass. The most important factors affecting change in soil C were previous land use, climate and the type of forest established. Results suggest that most soil C was lost when softwoods, particularly Pinus radiata plantations, were established on ex-improved pastoral land in temperate regions. Accumulation of soil C was greatest when deciduous hardwoods, or N-2-fixing species (either as an understorey or as a plantation), were established on ex-cropped land in tropical or subtropical regions. Long-term management regimes (e.g. stocking, weed control, thinning, fertiliser application and fire management) may also influence accumulation of soil C. Accumulation is maximised by maintaining longer (20-50 years) forest rotations. Furthermore, inclusion of litter in calculations reversed the observed average decrease in soil C, so that amount of C in soil and litter layer was greater than under preceding pasture.

Most importantly, almost every change in building design, product selection alternative or forest management alternative results in changed levels of carbon emissions across many different stages of processing. These studies raise questions about the effectiveness of carbon registries, cap and trade systems or taxes to effectively monetize the reduction of carbon emissions. A three-tier credit system that accounts for carbon sequestration and storage in the forest sector including users of forest products can mimic many of the expected effects of an economy-wide carbon tax.

M.","Effects of a thinning treatment on carbon stocks in a northern Arizona ponderosa pine forest","Forest Ecology and Management","","0378-1127","10.1016/j.foreco.2008.01.041","","Vast areas of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forest in the western United States have become unnaturally dense because of relatively recent land management practices that include fire suppression and livestock grazing. In many areas, thinning treatments can re-establish the natural ecological processes and help restore ecosystem structure and function. Precipitous global climate change has focused attention on the carbon storage in forests. An unintended consequence of fire suppression has been the increased storage of carbon in ponderosa stands. Thinning treatments reduce standing carbon stocks while releasing carbon through the combustion of fuel in logging machinery, burning slash, and the decay of logging slash and wood products. These reductions and releases of stored carbon must be compared to the risk of catastrophic fire burning through the stand and releasing large quantities of carbon to the atmosphere to more fully understand the costs and benefits - in carbon terms - of forest restoration strategies. This study examines the effect of a restoration thinning treatment on the carbon stock of a ponderosa pine forest. The total pre-treatment above-ground carbon stock was 48,880 kg C ha(-1) and the post-treatment stand had 36,420 kg C ha(-1). The carbon stock in trees across the stand ranged from 28,560 to 67,560 kg C ha-1 pre-treatment and from 11,970 to 55,510 kg C ha-1 post-treatment. 8240 kg C ha(-1) was removed from the site and sold to the wholesale firewood market (plot values ranged from 4890 to 12,3 10 kg C ha(-1)), 91 kg C hat was released from the combustion of fuel in harvesting operations and trucking, and the processing of the firewood required carbon released 33 kg C ha(-1). The burning of slash piled on site released 4140 kg C ha(-1) (plot values ranged from 2920 to 6900 kg C ha(-1)). We estimated that in a stand-replacing fire, the treated stand would release 2410 kg C ha(-1) less to the atmosphere than the untreated stand. However, the thinning treatment resulted in stand structural changes that make the stand less likely to support a crown fire and therefore more likely to avoid the carbon releases associated with crown fires, even under extreme fire conditions. On balance, the thinning treatment released 3114 kg C ha(-1). If the wood removed from the site had been used in longer-lasting products, the thinning could have resulted in net carbon storage on the order of 3351 kg C ha(-1). (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Following a 200 000 ha mixed-severity wildfire in Oregon, USA, we quantified (1) conifer and broadleaf regeneration in stand-replacement patches 2 and 4 years postfire; and (2) the relative importance of isolation from seed sources (live trees) versus local site conditions in controlling regeneration. Patch-scale conifer regeneration density (72%-80% Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb). Franco)) varied widely, from 127 to 6494 stems.ha(-1). Median densities were 1721 and 1603 stems.ha(-1) 2 and 4 years postfire, respectively, i.e., similar to 12 times prefire overstory densities (134 stems.ha(-1)). Because of the complex burn mosaic, similar to 58% of stand-replacement area was <= 200 m from a live-tree edge (seed source), and similar to 81% was <= 400 m. Median conifer density exceeded 1000 stems.ha(-1) out to a distance of 400 m from an edge before declining farther away. The strongest controls on regeneration were distance to live trees and soil parent material, with skeletal coarse-grained soils supporting lower densities (133 stems.ha(-1)) than fine-grained soils (729-1492 stems.ha(-1)). Other site factors (e. g., topography, broadleaf cover) had little association with conifer regeneration.

Results indicate that houses with wood-based wall systems require 15-16% less total energy for non-heating/cooling purposes than thermally comparable houses employing alternative steel- or concrete-based building systems. Results for non-renewable energy consumption are essentially the same as those for total energy, reflecting the fact that most of the displaced energy is in fossil fuels. Over a 100-year period, net greenhouse gas emissions associated with wood-based houses are 20-50% lower than emissions associated with thermally comparable houses employing steel- or concrete-based building systems. Assuming 1.5 million single-family housing starts per year, the difference between wood and non-wood building systems represents about 9.6 Mt Of CO2 equivalents per year. The corresponding energy benefit associated with wood-based building materials is approximately 132 PJ year(-1). These estimates represent about 22% of embodied energy and 27% of embodied greenhouse gas emissions in the residential sector of the US economy. The results of the analysis are very sensitive to assumptions and uncertainties regarding the fate of forestland that is taken out of wood production due to reduced demand for wood, the continued production of co-products where demand for wood products is reduced, and the rate at which carbon accumulates in forests.

A mechanistic forest ecosystem simulator, which couples carbon, nitrogen and water (Edinburgh Forest Model), was calibrated to mimic the growth of a pine plantation in a Scottish climate. The model was then run to equilibrium (1) as an undisturbed forest, (2) removing 2.5, 10, 20 or 40% of the woody biomass each year (3) removing 50% of the woody biomass every 20 years, and (4) clear-felling and replanting every 60 years as in conventional plantations in this climate. More carbon was stored in the undisturbed forest (35.2 kg C m(-2)) than in any regime in which wood was harvested. Plantation management gave moderate carbon storage (14.3 kg C m(-2)) and timber yield (15.6 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)). Notably, annual removal of 10 or 20% of woody biomass per year gave both a high timber yield (25 m3 ha(-1) year(-1)) and high carbon storage (20 to 24 kg C m(-2)). The efficiency of the latter regimes could be attributed (in the model) to high light interception and net primary productivity, but less evapotranspiration and summer water stress than in the undisturbed forest, high litter input to the soil giving high soil carbon and N-2 fixation, low maintenance respiration and low N leaching owing to soil mineral pool depletion. We conclude that there is no simple inverse relationship between the amount of timber harvested from a forest and the amount of carbon stored. Management regimes that maintain a continuous canopy cover and mimic, to some extent, regular natural forest disturbance are likely to achieve the best combination of high wood yield and carbon storage.","2000-04","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2021-12-06 17:23:43","","477-484","","7","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000086556200006","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\STSE5XYY\Thornley and Cannell - 2000 - Managing forests for wood yield and carbon storage.pdf","","Management; Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Wood products","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Challenges arise because woody encroachment is governed by ecological processes that occur at fine spatial resolutions (1-10 m) and, in many cases, at slow (decadal-scale) temporal rates over large areas. We therefore analyzed time series aerial photography, which exhibits both the necessary spatial precision and temporal extent, to quantify the expansion of western juniper into sagebrush steppe landscapes in southwestern Idaho. We established upper and lower bounds of aboveground woody carbon change across the landscape via two-dimensional spatial wavelet analysis, image texture analysis, and field data collection. Forty-eight 100-ha blocks across a 330,000-ha region were stratified by topography, soil characteristics, and land stewardship for analyses. Across the area we estimate aboveground woody carbon accumulation rates of 3.3 gCm(-2) yr(-1) and 10.0 gCm(-2) yr(-1) using the wavelet and texture method, respectively, during the time period 1946-1998. Carbon accumulation rates were significantly affected by soil properties and were highly dependent on the spatial and temporal scales of analysis. For example, at a 100-ha scale the aboveground carbon accumulation varied from -1.7 to 9.9 gCm(-2) yr(-1), while at the 1-ha scale the range of variability increased to -11 to 22 gCm(-2) yr(-1). These values are an order of magnitude lower than those previously suggested due to woody encroachment, highlighting the need for examining multiple spatial scales when accounting for changes in terrestrial carbon storage.","2008-02-12","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-09 20:33:25","","G01013","","G1","113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000253234100003","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QH4ETC9N\Strand et al. - 2008 - Net changes in aboveground woody carbon stock in w.pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we explore the effect of two contrasting types of disturbances (i.e., fire and tree harvest) on landscape level NECB by using an ecosystem process model that explicitly accounts for changes in carbon (C) stores as a function of disturbance regimes. The latter were defined by the average disturbance interval, the regularity of the disturbance interval (i.e., random, based on a Poisson frequency distribution, or regular), the amount of C removed by the disturbance (i.e., severity), and the relative abundance of stands in the landscape with unique disturbance histories. We used the model to create over 300 hypothetical landscapes, each with a different disturbance regime, by simulating up to 200 unique stand histories and averaging their total C stores. Mean NECB and its year-to-year variability was computed by calculating the difference in mean total C stores from one year to the next. Results indicated that landscape C stores were higher for random than for regular disturbance intervals, and increased as the mean disturbance interval increased and as the disturbance severity decreased. For example, C storage was reduced by 58% when the fire interval was shortened from 250 years to 100 years. Average landscape NECB was not significantly different than zero for any of the simulated landscapes. Year-to-year variability in landscape NECB, however, was related to the landscape disturbance regime; increasing with disturbance severity and frequency, and higher for random versus regular disturbance intervals. We conclude that landscape C stores of forest systems can be predicted using the concept of disturbance regimes, a result that may be a useful for adjusting estimates of C storage to broad scales that are solely based on physiological processes.","2007-01","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-09 19:11:11","","77-94","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000243619800008","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\2EIW2DC6\Smithwick et al. - 2007 - Changing temporal patterns of forest carbon stores.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It does not count CO2 emitted from tailpipes and smokestacks when bioenergy is being used, but it also does not count changes in emissions from land use when biomass for energy is harvested or grown. This accounting erroneously treats all bioenergy as carbon neutral regardless of the source of the biomass, which may cause large differences in net emissions. For example, the clearing of long-established forests to burn wood or to grow energy crops is counted as a 100% reduction in energy emissions despite causing large releases of carbon. Several recent studies estimate that this error, applied globally, would create strong incentives to clear land as carbon caps tighten. One study ( 2) estimated that a global CO2 target of 450 ppm under this accounting would cause bioenergy crops to expand to displace virtually all the world’s natural forests and savannahs by 2065, releasing up to 37 gigatons (Gt) of CO2 per year (comparable to total human CO2 emissions today). Another study predicts that, based solely on economic considerations, bioenergy could displace 59% of the world’s natural forest cover and release an additional 9 Gt of CO2 per year to achieve a 50% “cut” in greenhouse gases by 2050 ( 3). The reason: When bioenergy from any biomass is counted as carbon neutral, economics favor large-scale land conversion for bioenergy regardless of the actual net emissions ( 4).","2009-10-23","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2021-01-20 22:12:14","","527-528","","5952","326","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000271019400024","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\2EDBX56C\Searchinger et al. - 2009 - Fixing a Critical Climate Accounting Error.pdf","","Journal Article; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These adverse impacts - from higher probabilities of category 4 and 5 hurricanes to higher rates of sea-level rise are found not in some distant unpopulated region, but rather right in our own back yards. On page 940 of this issue, Westerling et al. come to a similarly discomforting conclusion for wildfires. They show that warmer temperatures appear to be increasing the duration and intensity of the wildfire season in the western United States. Since 1986, longer, warmer summers have resulted in a four fold increase of major wildfires and a sixfold increase in the area of forest burned, compared to the period from 1970 to 1986. A similar increase in wildfire activity has been reported in Canada from 1920 to 1999. Westerling et al. used the most comprehensive data set of wildfire occurrences yet compiled for the western United States to analyze the geographic location, seasonal timing, and regional climatology of the 1166 recorded wildfires with an extent of more than 400 ha. They found that the length of the active wildfire season (when fires are actually burning) in the western United States has increased by 78 days, and that the average burn duration of large fires has increased from 7.5 to 37.1 days. Based on comparisons with climatic indices that use daily weather records to estimate land surface dryness, Westerling et al. attribute this increase in wildfire activity to an increase in spring and summer temperatures by about 0.9°C and a 1- to 4- week earlier melting of mountain snowpacks. Snow-dominated forests at elevations of about 2100 m show the greatest increase in wildfire activity.","2006-08-18","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2021-03-03 23:13:14","","927-928","","5789","313","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000239817000029","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\2JNKRWA5\Running - 2006 - Is global warming causing more, larger wildfires.pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An ecosystem carbon model was used to generate new national maps of annual net primary production (NPP), one each for continuous land covers of 'forest', 'crop', and 'rangeland' over the entire U. S. continental area. Direct inputs of satellite ""greenness"" data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor into the NASA-CASA carbon model at 8-km spatial resolution were used to estimate spatial variability in monthly NPP and potential biomass accumulation rates in a uniquely detailed manner. The model predictions of regrowth forest production lead to a conservative national projection of 0.3 Pg C as potential carbon stored each year on relatively low-production crop or rangeland areas. On a regional level, the top five states for total crop afforestation potential were: Texas, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri, whereas the top five states for total rangeland afforestation potential are: Texas, California, Montana, New Mexico, and Colorado. Afforestation at this level of intensity has the capacity to offset at least one-fifth of annual fossil fuel emission of carbon in the United States. These projected afforestation carbon gains also match or exceed recent estimates of the annual sink for atmospheric CO2 in currently forested area of the country.","2007-02","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2021-12-07 19:55:11","","323-336","","3-4","80","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000243803300009","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QZZCRVT5\Potter et al. - 2007 - Satellite-derived estimates of potential carbon se.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Sequestration; Growth; Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further increases in area burned could contribute positive feedback to climate change. We made probabilistic forecasts of the recovery of C sinks in Canada's managed forest between 2010 and 2100 under two assumptions about future area burned by wildfire: (1) no increase relative to levels observed in the last half of the 20th century and (2) linear increases by a factor of two or four (depending on region) from 2010 to 2100. Recovery of strong C sinks in Canada's managed forest will be delayed until at least the 2030s because of insect outbreaks, even if predicted increases in area annually burned do not occur. After 2050, our simulations project an annual probability of a sink near 70% with no increase in area burned and 35% with increasing area burned. All simulations project a cumulative C source from 2010-2100, even if annual area burned does not increase. If the sink strength of terrestrial ecosystems is reduced because of increasing natural disturbances, then it will become more difficult to achieve global atmospheric CO2 stabilization targets.","2010-11","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-07 22:58:20","","719-728","","5","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000283167300031","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ZQUXHE8L\Metsaranta et al. - 2010 - Implications of future disturbance regimes on the .pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Pools; Journal Article; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sustainability of the U. S. carbon sink and the extent of fire activity in the next 100 yr depend in part on the type and effectiveness of fire reduction employed. Previous studies have bracketed the range of dynamics from continued fire reduction to the complete failure of fire reduction activities. To improve these estimates, it is necessary to explicitly account for fire reduction in terrestrial models. A new fire reduction submodel that estimates the spatiotemporal pattern of reduction across the United States was developed using gridded data on biomass, climate, land-use, population, and economic factors. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first large-scale, gridded fire model that explicitly accounts for fire reduction. The model was calibrated to 1 x 1 burned area statistics [ Global Burnt Area 2000 Project (GBA-2000)] and compared favorably to three important diagnostics. The model was then implemented in a spatially explicit ecosystem model and used to analyze 1620 scenarios of future fire risk and fire reduction strategies. Under scenarios of climate change and urbanization, burned area and carbon emissions both increased in scenarios where fire reduction efforts were not adjusted to match new patterns of fire risk. Fuel reducing management strategies reduced burned area and fire risk, but also limited carbon storage. These results suggest that to promote carbon storage and minimize fire risk in the future, fire reduction efforts will need to be increased and spatially adjusted and will need to employ a mixture of fuel-reducing and non-fuel-reducing strategies.","2007","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-06 22:37:12","","2","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000244013700001","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ZR6VXGEQ\Girod et al. - 2007 - The tension between fire risk and carbon storage .pdf","","Fire; Management; Modeling; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data on the production of wood products and emission from decomposition were used to estimate carbon stocks and sequestration rates in wood products and landfills. From 1990 through 2005, the forest sector (including forests and wood products) sequestered an average 162 Tg C year(-1). In 2005, 49% of the total forest sector sequestration was in live and dead trees, 27% was in wood products in landfills, with the remainder in down dead wood, wood products in use, and forest floor and soil. The pools with the largest carbon stocks were not the same as those with the largest sequestration rates, except for the tree pool. For example, landfilled wood products comprise only 3% of total stocks but account for 27% of carbon sequestration. Conversely, forest soils comprise 48% of total stocks but account for only 2% of carbon sequestration. For the tree pool, the spatial pattern of carbon stocks was dissimilar to that of carbon flux. On an area basis, tree carbon stocks were highest in the Pacific Northwest, while changes were generally greatest in the upper Midwest and the Northeast. Net carbon sequestration in the forest sector in 2005 offset 10% of U.S. CO2 emissions. In the near future, we project that U.S. forests will continue to sequester carbon at a rate similar to that in recent years. Based on a comparison of our estimates to a compilation of land-based estimates of non-forest carbon sinks from the literature, we estimate that the conterminous U.S. annually sequesters 149-330 Tg C year(-1).

However, planning horizons and response time to changes in forest management are usually long and the respective GHG effects related to the use of wood depend on the availability of harvested wood. Therefore, an integral long-term strategic approach is required to formulate the most effective forest and wood management strategies for mitigating climate change. The greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics related to the production, use and disposal of wood products are manifold and show a complex time pattern. On the one hand, wood products can be considered as a carbon pool, as is the forest itself. On the other hand, an increased use of wood can lead to the substitution of usually more energy-intense materials and to the substitution of fossil fuels when the thermal energy of wood is recovered. Country-specific import/export flows of wood products and their alternative products as well as their processing stage have to be considered if substitution effects are assessed on a national basis. We present an integral model-based approach to evaluate the GHG impacts of various forest management and wood use scenarios. Our approach allows us to analyse the complex temporal and spatial patterns of GHG emissions and removals including trade-offs of different forest management and wood use strategies. This study shows that the contributions of the forestry and timber sector to mitigate climate change can be optimized with the following key recommendations: (1) the maximum possible, sustainable increment should be generated in the forest, taking into account biodiversity conservation as well as the long-term preservation of soil quality and growth performance; (2) this increment should be harvested continuously; (3) the harvested wood should be processed in accordance with the principle of cascade use, i.e. first be used as a material as long as possible, preferably in structural components; (4) waste wood that is not suitable for further use should be used to generate energy. Political strategies to solely increase the use of wood as a biofuel cannot be considered efficient from a climate perspective; (5) forest management strategies to enhance carbon sinks in forests via reduced harvesting are not only ineffective because of a compensatory increase in fossil fuel consumption for the production of non-wooden products and thermal energy but also because of the Kyoto-""cap"" that limits the accountability of GHG removals by sinks under Article 3.3 and 3.4, at least for the first commitment period; (6) the effect of substitution through the material and energy use of wood is more significant and sustained as compared with the stock effects in wood products, which tend towards new steady-state flow equilibria with no further increase of C stocks; (7) from a global perspective, the effect of material substitution exceeds that of energy recovery from wood. In the Swiss context, however, the energy recovery from wood generates a greater substitution effect than material substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A sensitivity analysis for assessing which factors are most important in shaping these curves is also presented. In the IPCC SRES B2 Scenario, the carbon sequestration potential on abandoned agricultural land increases from 60 MtC/year in 2010 to 2,700 MtC/year in 2100 for prices up to 1,000 $/tC, assuming harvest when the mean annual increment decreases and assuming no environmental, economical or political barriers in the implementation-phase. Taking these barriers into consideration would reduce the potential by at least 60%. On the other hand, the potential will increase 55 to 75% if plantations on harvested timberland are considered. Taking into account land and establishment costs, the largest part of the potential up to 2025 can be supplied below 100 $/tC (In this article all dollar values are in US dollars of 1995, unless indicated otherwise.). Beyond 2050, more than 50% of the costs come to over 200 $/tC. Compared to other mitigation options, this is relative cheap. So a large part of the potential will likely be used in an overall mitigation strategy. However, since huge emission reductions are probably needed, the relative contribution of plantations will be low (around 3%). The largest source of uncertainty with respect to both potentials and costs is the growth rate of plantations compared to the natural vegetation.","2008-06","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-09 23:05:54","","343-366","","3-4","88","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000256476100006","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\XCQUVUCD\Strengers et al. - 2008 - The role of carbon plantations in mitigating clima.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Economics; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe a modeled estimate of terrestrial carbon storage arising from deposition of nitrogen derived from fossil fuels that accounts for spatial distributions in deposition and vegetation types, turnover of plant and soil carbon pools, and the cumulative effects of deposition, Vegetation type has a pronounced effect on C uptake; the combination of high C:N ratios and long lifetimes in wood may create a significant sink in forests, but much of the nitrogen falls on cultivated areas and grasslands, where there is limited capacity for long-term carbon storage. We estimate 1990 net carbon uptake due to deposition of fossil-fuel N to be between 0.3 and 1.3 Pg C/yr [1 Pg = 10(15) g], depending on the fraction of C allocated to wood, with a best estimate of 0.44-0.74 Pg/yr. Cumulative C storage since 1845 is estimated to be about 25% of the proposed terrestrial sink for anthropogenic CO2. Continued exposure to high N deposition, however, will decrease the extent of N limitation in terrestrial ecosystems, thereby limiting the persistence of any N-derived carbon sink.","1996-08","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-10 00:09:39","","806-814","","3","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1996UZ41200027","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\NS29GEG6\Townsend et al. - 1996 - Spatial and temporal patterns in terrestrial carbo.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The potential, upper bound to C storage is difficult to approximate in the field because it requires studying old-growth forests, of which few remain. In this paper, we put an upper bound (or limit) on C storage in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States using field data from old-growth forests, which are near steady-state conditions. Specifically, the goals of this study were: (1) to approximate the upper bounds of C storage in the PNW by estimating total ecosystem carbon (TEC) stores of 43 old-growth forest stands in five distinct biogeoclimatic provinces and (2) to compare these TEC storage estimates with those from other biomes, globally. Finally, we suggest that the upper bounds of C storage in forests of the PNW are higher than current estimates of C stores, presumably due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic disturbances, which indicates a potentially substantial and economically significant role of C sequestration in the region. Results showed that coastal Oregon stands stored, on average, 1127 Mg C/ha, which was the highest for the study area, while stands in eastern Oregon stored the least, 195 Mg C/ha. In general, coastal Oregon stands stored 307 Mg C/ha more than coastal Washington stands. Similarly, the Oregon Cascades stands stored 75 Mg C/ha more, on average, than the Washington Cascades stands. A simple, area-weighted average TEC storage to I m soil depth (TEC,,,) for the PNW was 671 Mg C/ha. When soil was included only to 50 cm (TEC(50)), the area-weighted average was 640 Mg C/ha. Subtracting estimates of current forest C storage from the potential, upper bound of C storage in this study, a maximum of 338 Mg C/ha (TEC(100)) could be stored in PNW forests in addition to current stores.","2002-10","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2021-12-06 16:58:36","","1303-1317","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000179198600006","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\Y6TFJ8PF\Smithwick et al. - 2002 - Potential upper bounds of carbon stores in forests.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The south- east and California experienced the largest relative area burned by fires from human ignitions. No significant differences were detected in the relative area burned by lightning in California, the upper and central Rocky Mountains, and the south- west, which all experienced the highest levels. The north- west and Rocky Mountains have experienced significant increases in the relative total area burned; the north- east, south- east, California, and coastal Alaska all remained unchanged. The northern Rocky Mountains, south- west, and north- east have all experienced significant increases in the amount of area burned by lightning without significant increases in lightning ignitions. Increasing fuel hazards in these areas probably contributed to the increasing area burned by lightning fires; changing climate could have also contributed to the increase in wildfire area from 1940 to 2000. To be effective across the diverse forest types and conditions in the USA, fire policy should better recognize and respond to the diversity of US forests and how they have burned in the past.

This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the ""dust bowl'' era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4-1.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6-1.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding approximate to 1,000 ppmv.

The forest carbon budget simulation model, FORCARB2, makes estimates for US forests primarily based on inventory data. We discuss methods to develop consistent carbon budget estimates from inventory data at varying levels of detail. Total carbon stored on public forestlands in the conterminous US increased from 16.3 Gt in 1953 to the present total of 19.5 Gt, while area increased from 87.1 million hactares to 92.1 million hactares.

Such strategies can affect the net Aux of carbon to the atmosphere through 4 mechanisms: storage of C in the biosphere; storage of C in forest products; use of biofuels to displace fossil-fuel use; use of wood products which often displaces other products that require more fossil fuel for their production. We use the mathematical model GORCAM (Graz/Oak Ridge Carbon Accounting Model) to examine these mechanisms for 16 land-use scenarios. Over long time intervals the amount of C stored in the biosphere and in forest products reaches a steady state and continuing mitigation of C emissions depends on the extent to which fossil fuel use is displaced by the use of bioenergy and wood products. The relative effectiveness of alternative forest and bioenergy strategies and their impact on net C emissions strongly depend, for example, on the productivity of the site, its current usage, and the efficiency with which the harvest is used. When growth rates are high and harvest is used efficiently, the dominant opportunity for net reduction in C emissions is seen to be fossil-fuel displacement. At the growth rates and efficiencies of harvest utilization adopted in many of our base scenarios, the net C balance at the end of 100 years is very similar whether trees are harvested and used for energy and traditional forest products, or reforestation and forest protection strategies are implemented. The C balance on a plantation system that provides a constant output of biomass products can look different than the balance of a single parcel of land.

Three tree species, white spruce (Picea glauca), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), were each used in combination with different rotation lengths. An additional run was conducted to investigate the effect of nitrogen addition to aspen. Results were also compared with a natural disturbance scenario in which a mixedwood stand composed of all three species was subjected to a catastrophic wildfire, on a 150-year fire cycle. All simulations included an understory grass competitor, Calamagrostis canadensis, and the total simulation length for each scenario was 300 years. Carbon stored in soil represented a large, relatively stable pool and showed only minor long-term responses to harvesting activities. Tree biomass and litter pools, in contrast, fluctuated widely in concert with the harvest cycle. Calamagrostis was relatively unimportant as a carbon pool. Total ecosystem carbon increased with rotation length regardless of species, and this was attributable largely to changes in the live biomass pool. A 150-year pine, and a 200-year spruce rotation, were the only scenarios in which average total carbon storage exceeded that in the natural disturbance scenario. For equivalent rotation lengths, total carbon storage was the greatest in aspen, followed by pine and spruce, respectively. Application of nitrogen fertilizer to aspen increased average total carbon storage by 9%. This increase was attributable primarily to the storage in wood products and live biomass pools. The proportion of total carbon stored in the soil pool decreased as harvest frequency declined (i.e., at longer rotation lengths), while the proportion stored in litter pools was roughly equivalent among all scenarios. However, there was a consistent decline in soil carbon across the 300-year simulation period for managed stands. The natural disturbance scenario, in contrast, showed an increase in soil carbon over the same period. Species-specific biomass accumulation rates (an index of ecosystem productivity) were maximal in the shortest rotations for aspen, but in mid-length rotations for pine and spruce. Short rotation scenarios showed a marked drop in site productivity over subsequent rotations. The application of nitrogen fertilizer reduced the relative drop in site productivity for aspen. Our results suggest a trade-off between ecosystem storage capacity and timber production. By selecting the appropriate tree species and rotation length, however, it is possible to either balance these competing demands, or favour one value versus the other. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This carbon uptake is therefore limiting the extent of atmospheric and climatic change, but its long-term nature remains uncertain. Here we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of global and regional patterns of carbon exchange by terrestrial ecosystems. Atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen data confirm that the terrestrial biosphere was largely neutral with respect to net carbon exchange during the 1980s, but became a net carbon sink in the 1990s. This recent sink can be largely attributed to northern extratropical areas, and is roughly split between North America and Eurasia. Tropical land areas, however, were approximately in balance with respect to carbon exchange, implying a carbon sink that offset emissions due to tropical deforestation. The evolution of the terrestrial carbon sink is largely the result of changes in land use over time, such as regrowth on abandoned agricultural land and fire prevention, in addition to responses to environmental changes, such as longer growing seasons, and fertilization by carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Nevertheless, there remain considerable uncertainties as to the magnitude of the sink in different regions and the contribution of different processes.","2001-11-08","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2021-12-07 17:55:04","","169-172","","6860","414","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000172029100037","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\RJ3VP6IR\Schimel et al. - 2001 - Recent patterns and mechanisms of carbon exchange .pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Aquatic; Transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This accumulation process essentially reverses some of the effects responsible for soil organic carbon losses from when the land was converted from perennial vegetation. We discuss the essential elements of what is known about soil organic matter dynamics that may result in enhanced soil carbon sequestration with changes in land-use and soil management. We review literature that reports changes in soil organic carbon after changes in land-use that favour carbon accumulation. This data summary provides a guide to approximate rates of SOC sequestration that are possible with management, and indicates the relative importance of some factors that influence the rates of organic carbon sequestration in soil. There is a large variation in the length of time for and the rate at which carbon may accumulate in soil, related to the productivity of the recovering vegetation, physical and biological conditions in the soil, and the past history of soil organic carbon inputs and physical disturbance. Maximum rates of C accumulation during the early aggrading stage of perennial vegetation growth, while substantial, are usually much less than 100 g C m(-2) y(-1.) Average rates of accumulation are similar for forest or grassland establishment: 33.8 g C m(-2) y(-1) and 33.2 g C m(-2) y(-1), respectively. These observed rates of soil organic C accumulation, when combined with the small amount of land area involved, are insufficient to account for a significant fraction of the missing C in the global carbon cycle as accumulating in the soils of formerly agricultural land.","2000-03","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-09 18:34:07","","317-327","","3","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000086198100006","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\VDG55H73\Post and Kwon - 2000 - Soil carbon sequestration and land-use change pro.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Sequestration; Soil; Land use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GRC3 was tested in seven regional case studies of eucalypt or Pinus radiata plantations in Australia to predict rates of change in soil C after afforestation and to determine controlling factors. The model was calibrated as far as possible to above-ground growth of plantations, litterfall, accumulation of litter and in some cases root biomass, and was then run to determine expected change in soil C. Between 0 and 10 years soil C was predicted to decrease by an average of 1.7% per year (0.79 t C ha(-1) per year) and between 10 and 40 years it was predicted to increase by 0.82% per year (0.46 t C ha(-1) per year). The mean rate of change after 40 years was 0.09% per year (0.06 t C ha(-1) per year). These values and pattern of change were consistent with a recent review of the global literature of change in soil C after afforestation [For. Ecol. Manage. (2002a)]. Modelling analyses suggests the main reasons for this pattern are: (i) initially, there are limited inputs of C to soil as plantation net primary production (NPP) is small and goes to building biomass. Residues from the previous crop decompose leading to net loss of C unless a groundcover (intercrop or weeds) is maintained in the inter-rows, (ii) much of the plantation NPP is allocated to long-lived woody components (stems, branches, and coarse roots), which are temporarily or permanently (by harvesting) removed from the soil C cycle, and (iii) as the stand develops, inputs from the more lignified, resistant material increases. The amount of input may be less under plantation than pasture but the quality of residues is the over-riding factor and in the long-term soil C accumulates. Actual trends in soil C may vary according to site and management conditions, but the main controlling factors will be different between pasture and plantation in the amount and allocation of NPP, and the quantity and quality of residue inputs to soil. Sensitivity (Monte Carlo) analyses showed that model parameters and processes for which it will be important to have good estimates include the amount of NPP and its allocation to various plant components, rate constants for decomposition of litter and root residues, the proportion of C lost to respiration during decomposition of litter and soil C, and rate constants for humification (the proportion of decomposing above-ground litter that is transferred to soil). Changes in soil C were small compared with other forest pools and fluxes-after 40 years of afforestation less than 3% of the cumulative NPP was predicted to accumulate in soil. It is debatable whether it will be feasible or cost-effective to directly measure change in soil C over short-time frames (such as 5 years) for the purpose of claiming C credits under an emissions trading scheme. Modelling provides a useful alternative and at the very least can be used to identify sites and time frames where investment in soil C measurement may be warranted.

Coupled climate-carbon cycle models are sensitive to this negative feedback on atmospheric CO2, but model projections are uncertain because of the expectation that feedbacks through the nitrogen (N) cycle will reduce this so-called CO2 fertilization effect. We assessed whether N limitation caused a reduced stimulation of net primary productivity (NPP) by elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration over 11 y in a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment in a deciduous Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum) forest stand in Tennessee. During the first 6 y of the experiment, NPP was significantly enhanced in forest plots exposed to 550 ppm CO2 compared with NPP in plots in current ambient CO2, and this was a consistent and sustained response. However, the enhancement of NPP under elevated CO2 declined from 24% in 2001-2003 to 9% in 2008. Global analyses that assume a sustained CO2 fertilization effect are no longer supported by this FACE experiment. N budget analysis supports the premise that N availability was limiting to tree growth and declining over time -an expected consequence of stand development, which was exacerbated by elevated CO2. Leaf-and stand-level observations provide mechanistic evidence that declining N availability constrained the tree response to elevated CO2; these observations are consistent with stand-level model projections. This FACE experiment provides strong rationale and process understanding for incorporating N limitation and N feedback effects in ecosystem and global models used in climate change assessments.","2010-11-09","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-07 23:31:12","","19368-19373","","45","107","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000283997800045","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\3QS6VWGS\Norby et al. - 2010 - CO2 enhancement of forest productivity constrained.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It analyzed the behavior of three carbon pools associated with forest products: the forest, forest products, and fossil fuel displaced by forest products in end-use markets. The LCA provided data that allowed us to create an accounting system that tracked carbon from sequestration to substitution in forest product end-use markets. The accounts are time-dependent since the size of the carbon pools is influenced by harvest timing; hence the size of each pool is estimated under alternative harvesting scenarios and presented over time. The analysis of the alternative harvesting scenarios resulted in shorter harvest cycles and provided the largest carbon pools when all three pools were considered together. The study concluded that forest products led to a significant reduction in atmospheric carbon by displacing more fossil fuel-intensive products in housing construction. The result has important policy implications since any incentive to manage forest lands to produce a greater amount of forest products would likely increase the share of lands positively contributing to a reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.","2005-12","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-08 00:10:01","","140-148","","","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000234902900012","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\LRAZPSH5\Perez-Garcia et al. - 2005 - An assessment of carbon pools, storage, and wood p.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Life Cycle; Wood products; Offset","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The net carbon flux from the atmosphere to the Land was higher, 0.37 to 0.71 petagrams of carbon per year, because a net flux of 0.07 to 0.13 petagrams of carbon per year was exported by rivers and commerce and returned to the atmosphere elsewhere.

Although component estimates are uncertain, about one-half of the total is outside the forest sector. We also estimated the sink using atmospheric models and the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (the tracer-transport inversion method). The range of results from the atmosphere-based inversions contains the Land-based estimates. Atmosphere- and land-based estimates are thus consistent, within the Large ranges of uncertainty for both methods.

Although forest management may have substantial impacts on soil C storage, experimental data from forest harvesting studies have not been synthesized recently. To quantify the effects of harvesting on soil C, and to identify sources of variation in soil C responses to harvest, we used meta-analysis to test a database of 432 soil C response ratios drawn from temperate forest harvest studies around the world. Harvesting reduced soil C by an average of 8 +/- 3% (95% CI), although numerous sources of variation mediated this significant, overall effect. In particular, we found that C concentrations and C pool sizes responded differently to harvesting, and forest floors were more likely to lose C than mineral soils. Harvesting caused forest floor C storage to decline by a remarkably consistent 30 +/- 6%, but losses were significantly smaller in coniferous/mixed stands (-20%) than hardwoods (-36%). Mineral soils showed no significant, overall change in C storage due to harvest, and variation among mineral soils was best explained by soil taxonomy. Alfisols and Spodosols exhibited no significant changes, and Inceptisols and Ultisols lost mineral soil C (-13% and -7%, respectively). However, these C losses were neither permanent nor unavoidable. Controls on variation within orders were not consistent, but included species composition, time, and sampling depth. Temporal patterns and soil C budgets suggest that forest floor C losses probably have a lesser impact on total soil C storage on Alfisols, Inceptisols, and Ultisols than on Spodosols, which store proportionately large amounts of C in forest floors with long C recovery times (50-70 years). Mineral soil C losses on Inceptisols and Ultisols indicate that these orders are vulnerable to significant harvest-induced changes in total soil C storage, but alternative residue management and site preparation techniques, and the passage of time, may mitigate or negate these losses. Key findings of this analysis, including the dependence of forest floor and mineral soil C storage changes on species composition and soil taxonomic order, suggest that further primary research may make it possible to create predictive maps of forest harvesting effects on soil C storage.","2010-02-20","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2021-12-07 19:43:17","","857-866","","5","259","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000275223300001","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\C6QS2V99\Nave et al. - 2010 - Harvest impacts on soil carbon storage in temperat.pdf","","Management; Pools; Journal Article; Soil; Harvest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that a large area (approximately 120000 km 2) of California and western Nevada experienced a notable increase in the extent of forest stand-replacing (""high severity'') fire between 1984 and 2006. High severity forest fire is closely linked to forest fragmentation, wildlife habitat availability, erosion rates and sedimentation, post-fire seedling recruitment, carbon sequestration, and various other ecosystem properties and processes. Mean and maximum fire size, and the area burned annually have also all risen substantially since the beginning of the 1980s, and are now at or above values from the decades preceding the 1940s, when fire suppression became national policy. These trends are occurring in concert with a regional rise in temperature and a long-term increase in annual precipitation. A close examination of the climate-fire relationship and other evidence suggests that forest fuels are no longer limiting fire occurrence and behavior across much of the study region.

Published estimates of methane yields were used to estimate the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere from landfilled forest products. These calculations suggest that maximally only 30% of the carbon from paper and 0-3% of the carbon from wood are ever emitted as landfill gas. The remaining carbon, approximately 28 Tg in 1993, remains in the landfill indefinitely. Some of this carbon may be removed during leachate treatment, but a large portion is permanently sequestered when its impact on global warming is negligible. The placement of forest products in landfills serves as a significant carbon sink, and its importance in the global carbon balance should not be overlooked.

S. Pacific Northwest involve a perceived trade-off between. re restoration and carbon sequestration. The former strategy would reduce fuel ( and therefore C) that has accumulated through a century of. re suppression and exclusion which has led to extreme. re risk in some areas. The latter strategy would manage forests for enhanced C sequestration as a method of reducing atmospheric CO(2) and associated threats from global climate change. We explored the trade-off between these two strategies by employing a forest ecosystem simulation model, STANDCARB, to examine the effects of fuel reduction on. re severity and the resulting long-term C dynamics among three Pacific Northwest ecosystems: the east Cascades ponderosa pine forests, the west Cascades western hemlock-Douglas-fir forests, and the Coast Range western hemlock-Sitka spruce forests. Our simulations indicate that fuel reduction treatments in these ecosystems consistently reduced. re severity. However, reducing the fraction by which C is lost in a wild. re requires the removal of a much greater amount of C, since most of the C stored in forest biomass ( stem wood, branches, coarse woody debris) remains unconsumed even by high-severity wild. res. For this reason, all of the fuel reduction treatments simulated for the west Cascades and Coast Range ecosystems as well as most of the treatments simulated for the east Cascades resulted in a reduced mean stand C storage. One suggested method of compensating for such losses in C storage is to utilize C harvested in fuel reduction treatments as biofuels. Our analysis indicates that this will not be an effective strategy in the west Cascades and Coast Range over the next 100 years. We suggest that forest management plans aimed solely at ameliorating increases in atmospheric CO2 should forgo fuel reduction treatments in these ecosystems, with the possible exception of some east Cascades ponderosa pine stands with uncharacteristic levels of understory fuel accumulation. Balancing a demand for maximal landscape C storage with the demand for reduced wild. re severity will likely require treatments to be applied strategically throughout the landscape rather than indiscriminately treating all stands.","2009-04","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2021-12-07 19:45:09","","643-655","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000264309500014","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\MPLTGT5F\Mitchell et al. - 2009 - Forest fuel reduction alters fire severity and lon.pdf","","Fire; Management; Pools; Journal Article; Silviculture; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although forest expansion following agricultural abandonment is certainly responsible for an important fraction of this carbon sink activity, the additional effects on the carbon balance of established forests of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, increasing temperatures, changes in management practices and nitrogen deposition are difficult to disentangle, despite an extensive network of measurement stations(2,3). The relevance of this measurement effort has also been questioned(4), because spot measurements fail to take into account the role of disturbances, either natural ( fire, pests, windstorms) or anthropogenic ( forest harvesting). Here we show that the temporal dynamics following stand-replacing disturbances do indeed account for a very large fraction of the overall variability in forest carbon sequestration. After the confounding effects of disturbance have been factored out, however, forest net carbon sequestration is found to be overwhelmingly driven by nitrogen deposition, largely the result of anthropogenic activities(5). The effect is always positive over the range of nitrogen deposition covered by currently available data sets, casting doubts on the risk of widespread ecosystem nitrogen saturation(6) under natural conditions.

We hypothesized that changes in plant available N and exploitation of deep sources of inorganic N in soils have sustained greater growth at elevated CO2. We employed a suite of assays performed in the sixth and 11th year of a CO2 enrichment experiment designed to assess soil N dynamics and N availability in the entire soil profile. In the 11th year, we found no differences in gross N flux, but significantly greater microbial respiration (P <= 0.01) at elevated CO2. Elevated CO2 lowered extractable inorganic N concentrations (P=0.096) considering the whole soil profile (0-190 cm). Conversely, potential net N mineralization, although not significant in considering the entire profile (P=0.460), tended to be greater at elevated CO2. Ion-exchange resins placed in the soil profile for approximately 1 year revealed that potential N availability at the water table was almost 3 x greater than found elsewhere in the profile, and we found direct evidence using a 15 N tracer study that plants took up N from the water table. Increased microbial respiration and shorter mean residence times of inorganic N at shallower depths suggests that enhanced SOM decomposition may promote a sustained supply of inorganic N at elevated CO2. Deep soil N availability at the water table is considerable, and provides a readily available source of N for plant uptake. Increased plant growth at elevated CO2 in this ecosystem may be sustained through greater inorganic N supply from shallow soils and N uptake from deep soil.","2009-08","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-07 22:42:53","","2035-2048","","8","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000267698400014","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\P7VJ2VVU\McKinley et al. - 2009 - Does deep soil N availability sustain long-term ec.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Grassland expanded, largely at the expense of Woodland and Shrubland, even under the cooler and less dry climate scenario where increased woody plant production was offset by increased wildfire. Increases in net primary productivity under the cooler and less dry scenario contributed to a simulated carbon sink of about 321 teragrams for California by the end of the century. Declines in net primary productivity under the two warmer and drier scenarios contributed to a net loss of carbon ranging from about 76 to 129 teragrams. Total annual area burned in California increased under all three scenarios, ranging from 9-15% above the historical norm by the end of the century. Annual biomass consumption by fire by the end of the century was about 18% greater than the historical norm under the more productive cooler and less dry scenario.

S. ecoprovinces, 1916-2003","Ecological Applications","","1051-0761","10.1890/07-1183.1","","The purpose of this paper is to quantify climatic controls on the area burned by fire in different vegetation types in the western United States. We demonstrate that wildfire area burned (WFAB) in the American West was controlled by climate during the 20th century (1916-2003). Persistent ecosystem-specific correlations between climate and WFAB are grouped by vegetation type (ecoprovinces). Most mountainous ecoprovinces exhibit strong year-of-fire relationships with low precipitation, low Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and high temperature. Grass and shrub dominated ecoprovinces had positive relationships with antecedent precipitation or PDSI. For 1977-2003, a few climate variables explain 33-87% (mean = 64%) of WFAB, indicating strong linkages between climate and area burned. For 1916-2003, the relationships are weaker, but climate explained 25-57% (mean = 39%) of the variability. The variance in WFAB is proportional to the mean squared for different data sets at different spatial scales. The importance of antecedent climate (summer drought in forested ecosystems and antecedent winter precipitation in shrub and grassland ecosystems) indicates that the mechanism behind the observed fire-climate relationships is climatic preconditioning of large areas of low fuel moisture via drying of existing fuels or fuel production and drying. The impacts of climate change on fire regimes will therefore vary with the relative energy or water limitations of ecosystems. Ecoprovinces proved a useful compromise between ecologically imprecise state-level and localized gridded fire data. The differences in climate fire relationships among the ecoprovinces underscore the need to consider ecological context (vegetation, fuels, and seasonal climate) to identify specific climate drivers of WFAB. Despite the possible influence of fire suppression, exclusion, and fuel treatment, WFAB is still substantially controlled by climate. The implications for planning and management are that future WFAB and adaptation to climate change will likely depend on ecosystem-specific, seasonal variation in climate. In fuel-limited ecosystems, fuel treatments can probably mitigate fire vulnerability and increase resilience more readily than in climate-limited ecosystems, in which large severe fires under extreme weather conditions will continue to account for most area burned.","2009-07","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2021-03-08 23:12:06","","1003-1021","","4","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000266281400015","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\LFLUSBIV\Littell et al. - 2009 - Climate and wildfire area burned in western U.

An analysis of the flow of mass, energy, and carbon from resources (such as a forest or mine pit) to products, and ultimately to disposal in a landfill or by recycling, is a complex undertaking. Any attempt to identify the environmental consequences of the life-cycle of houses constructed from alternative materials is burdened by enormous data requirements in order to characterize each stage of a product’s life-cycle. The complexity of modern house construction exacerbates the analysis, because many products made from different materials are used. In addition, the time element associated with the growth of forests, the manufacturing of the wood products, and the duration of the useful life of a house and its many components adds another layer of complexity. In 1996, the Consortium for Research on Renewable Industrial Materials (CORRIM) was formed by 15 research institutions as a nonprofit entity that would undertake research on the use of wood as a renewable material. In 1998, CORRIM published a 22-module research plan and protocol (CORRIM 1998) to develop a life-cycle assessment (LCA) for residential structures and other wood uses. The research plan required development of a complete life-cycle inventory (LCI) of all environmental inputs and outputs from forest regeneration through product manufacturing, building construction, use, maintenance, and disposal. Later, CORRIM published a summary and a Phase I Interim Report on the progress with a provisional LCI database to evaluate the environmental performance of building materials (Bowyer et. al 2001, 2002). The report also contained an LCA for residential structures focusing on energy use, air and water emissions, global warming potential (GWP), and solid waste production from resource extraction through construction. These five key performance indices were chosen to simplify the analysis. The process of developing an interim report allowed the research team to evaluate the LCI databases for use in each stage of processing “from cradle to grave” before finalizing them.","2004-06","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2021-01-20 22:27:01","","8-19","","6","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000222145800004","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\98PEGVMP\Lippke et al. - 2004 - CORRIM Life-cycle environmental performance of re.pdf","","Journal Article; Life Cycle; Wood products","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the industrial revolution, global emissions of carbon (C) are estimated at 270 +/- 30 Pg (Pg = petagram = 10(15) g = 1 billion ton) due to fossil fuel combustion and 136 55 Pg due to land use change and soil cultivation. Emissions due to land use change include those by deforestation, biomass burning, conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems, drainage of wetlands and soil cultivation. Depletion of soil organic C (SOC) pool have contributed 78 +/- 12 Pg of C to the atmosphere. Some cultivated soils have lost one-half to two-thirds of the original SOC pool with a cumulative loss of 30-40 Mg C/ha (Mg = megagram = 106 g = 1 ton). The depletion of soil C is accentuated by soil degradation and exacerbated by land misuse and soil mismanagement. Thus, adoption of a restorative land use and recommended management practices (RMPs) on agricultural soils can reduce the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO(2) while having positive impacts on food security, agro-industries, water quality and the environment. A considerable part of the depleted SOC pool can be restored through conversion of marginal lands into restorative land uses, adoption of conservation tillage with cover crops and crop residue mulch, nutrient cycling including the use of compost and manure, and other systems of sustainable management of soil and water resources. Measured rates of soil C sequestration through adoption of RMPs range from 50 to 1000 kg/ha/year. The global potential of SOC sequestration through these practices is 0.9 +/- 0.3 Pg C/year, which may offset one-fourth to one-third of the annual increase in atmospheric CO(2) estimated at 3.3 Pg C/year. The cumulative potential of soil C sequestration over 25-50 years is 30-60 Pg. The soil C sequestration is a truly win-win strategy. It restores degraded soils, enhances biomass production, purifies surface and ground waters, and reduces the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO(2) by offsetting emissions due to fossil fuel.

Stand-replacing fires switch ecosystems to being a net source of carbon as decomposition exceeds photosynthesis-a short-term effect (years to decades) that maybe important over the next century in fire frequency increases. Over the long term (many centuries), net carbon storage through afire cycle is zero if stands replace themselves. Therefore, equilibrium response of landscape carbon storage to changes in fire frequency will depend on how stand age distribution changes, on the carbon storage of different stand ages, and on postfire regeneration. In a case study of Yellowstone National Park, equilibrium values of landscape carbon storage were resistant to large changes in fire frequency because theseforests regenerate quickly, the current fire interval is very long, the most rapid changes in carbon storage occur in the first century, and carbon storage is similar for stands of different ages. The conversion of forest to meadow or to sparser forest can have a large impact on landscape carbon storage, and this process is likely to be important for many coniferforests.","2006-07","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-07 17:27:21","","598-606","","7","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000239017800011","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\PD6538K6\Kashian et al. - 2006 - Carbon storage on landscapes with stand-replacing .pdf","","Fire; Pools; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper reviews the literature on forest management effects on soil C and N and reports the results of a meta analysis of these data. The meta analysis showed that forest harvesting, on average, had little or no effect on soil C and N. Significant effects of harvest type and species were noted, with sawlog harvesting causing increases (+18%) in soil C and N and whole-tree harvesting causing decreases (-6%). The positive effect of sawlog harvesting appeared to be restricted to coniferous species. Fire resulted in no significant overall effects of fire on either C or N (when categories were combined); but there was a significant effect of time since fire, with an increase in both soil C and N after 10 years (compared to controls). Significant differences among fire treatments were found, with the counterintuitive result of lower soil C following prescribed fire and higher soil C following wildfire. The latter is attributed to the sequestration of charcoal and recalcitrant, hydrophobic organic matter and to the effects of naturally invading, post-fire, N-fixing vegetation. Both fertilization and N-fixing vegetation caused marked overall increases in soil C and N. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Utilization of terrestrial C sinks alleviates the burden of countries which are committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. Land-use changes such as those which result from afforestation and management of fast-growing tree species, have an immediate effect on the regional rate of C sequestration by incorporating carbon dioxide (CO2) in plant biomass. The potential for such practices is limited in Europe by environmental and political constraints. The management of existing forests can also increase C sequestration, but earlier reviews found conflicting evidence regarding the effects of forest management on soil C pools. We analyzed the effects of harvesting, thinning, fertilization application, drainage, tree species selection, and control of natural disturbances on soil C dynamics. We focused on factors that affect the C input to the soil and the C release via decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). The differentiation of SOM into labile and stable soil C fractions is important. There is ample evidence about the effects of management on the amount of C in the organic layers of the forest floor, but much less information about measurable effects of management on stable C pools in the mineral soil. The C storage capacity of the stable pool can be enhanced by increasing the productivity of the forest and thereby increasing the C input to the soil. Minimizing the disturbances in the stand structure and soil reduces the risk of unintended C losses. The establishment of mixed species forests increases the stability of the forest and can avoid high rates of SOM decomposition. The rate of C accumulation and its distribution within the soil profile differs between tree species. Differences in the stability of SOM as a direct species effect have not yet been reported.

With climate change increasingly likely, strategies to reduce carbon emissions and stabilize climate are needed, including greater energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, geoengineering, decarbonization, and geological and biological sequestration. Two of the most commonly proposed biological strategies are restoring organic carbon in agricultural soils and using plantations to sequester carbon in soils and wood. Here, we compare scenarios of land-based sequestration to emissions reductions arising from increased fuel efficiency in transportation, targeting ways to reduce net U.S. emissions by 10% (approximate to0.16 Pg of carbon per year). Based on mean sequestration rates, converting all U.S. croplands to no-till agriculture or retiring them completely could sequester approximate to0.059 Fig of carbon per year for several decades. Summary data across a range of plantations reveal an average rate of carbon storage an order of magnitude larger than in agricultural soils; in consequence, one-third of U.S. croplands or 44 million hectares would be needed for plantations to reach the target of approximate to0.16 Pg of carbon per year. For fossil fuel reductions, cars and light trucks generated approximate to0.31 Pg of carbon in U.S. emissions in 2001. To reduce net emissions by 0.16 Pg of carbon per year, a doubling of fuel efficiency for cars and light trucks is needed, a change feasible with current technology. issues of permanence, leakage, and economic potentials are discussed briefly, as is the recognition that such scenarios are only a first step in addressing total U.S. emissions.","2004-11-09","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-07 16:55:28","","15827-15829","","45","101","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000225196800002","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\9QWNXMB8\Jackson and Schlesinger - 2004 - Curbing the US carbon deficit.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, the climate benefits of carbon storage are often counteracted in boreal and other snow-covered regions, where darker trees trap more heat than snow does.

Our new economic modeling for the United States suggests that greenhouse gas payments of up to $50 per tCO(2)e could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 700 million tCO(2)e per year through afforestation, forest management, and bioelectricity generation. However, simulated carbon payments also imply the reduction of agricultural land area in the United States by 10% or more, decreasing agricultural exports and raising commodity food prices, imports, and leakage.

The simulations indicated that forests with frequent, but partial removal of live trees can store as much C as those with complete tree harvest on less frequent intervals. Stores in forest products generally declined as the fraction of live trees harvested declined and as the interval between harvests increased. Although the proportion of total system stores in forest products increased as the frequency of harvests and proportion of trees removed increased, this did not offset the reduction in forest C stores these treatments caused. Spatial arrangement of harvest influenced tree species composition profoundly; however, the effects of aggregated versus dispersed cutting patterns on C stores were relatively small compared to the other treatments.

The forest examined was typical of the Cascades of Oregon and dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg). Simulations were run until a C steady state was reached at the landscape level, and results were rescaled relative to the potential maximum C stored in a landscape. Simulation experiments indicated agricultural fields stored the least (15% of the maximum) and forests protected from fire stored the greatest amount (93% of the maximum) of landscape-level C. Conversion of old-growth forests to any other management or disturbance regime resulted in a net loss of C, whereas conversion of agricultural systems to forest systems had the opposite effect. The three factors, in order of increasing importance, most crucial in developing an optimum C storage system were (i) rotation length, (ii) amount of live mass harvested, and (iii) amount of detritus removed by slash burning. Carbon stores increased as rotation length increased but decreased as fraction of trees harvested and detritus removed increased. Simulations indicate partial harvest and minimal fire use may provide as many forest products as the traditional clearcut - broadcast-burn system while increasing C stores. Therefore, an adequate supply of wood products may not be incompatible with a system that increases C stores.","2002-05","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2021-12-07 19:45:09","","863-877","","5","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000175619300012","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\UZXP68RX\Harmon and Marks - 2002 - Effects of silvicultural practices on carbon store.pdf","","Management; Pools; Journal Article; Silviculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One barrier to including forest offsets in climate policy is the risk of reversal, the intentional or unintentional release of carbon back to the atmosphere due to storms, fire, pests, land use decisions, and many other factors. To address this shortcoming, a variety of different strategies have emerged to minimize either the risk or the financial and environmental implications of reversal. These strategies range from management decisions made at the individual stand level to buffers and set-asides that function across entire trading programs. For such strategies to work, the actual risk and magnitude of potential reversals need to be clearly understood. In this paper we examine three factors that are likely to influence reversal risk: natural disturbances (such as storms, fire, and insect outbreaks), climate change, and landowner behavior. Although increases in atmospheric CO2 and to a lesser extent warming will likely bring benefits to some forest ecosystems, temperature stress may result in others. Furthermore, optimism based on experimental results of physiology and growth must be tempered with knowledge that future large-scale disturbances and extreme weather events are also likely to increase. At the individual project level, management strategies such as manipulation of forest structure, age, and composition can be used to influence carbon sequestration and reversal risk. Because some management strategies have the potential to maximize risk or carbon objectives at the expense of the other, policymakers should ensure that forest offset policies and programs do not provide the singular incentive to maximize carbon storage. Given the scale and magnitude of potential disturbance events in the future, however, management decisions at the individual project level may be insufficient to adequately address reversal risk; other, non-silvicultural strategies and policy mechanisms may be necessary. We conclude with a brief review of policy mechanisms that have been developed or proposed to help manage or mitigate reversal risk at both individual project and policy-wide scales.

Here we show the global potential for bioenergy on abandoned agriculture lands to be less than 8% of current primary energy demand, based on historical land use data, satellite-derived land cover data, and global ecosystem modeling. The estimated global area of abandoned agriculture is 385-472 million hectares, or 66-110% of the areas reported in previous preliminary assessments. The area-weighted mean production of above-ground biomass is 4.3 tons ha(-1) Y-1, in contrast to estimates of up to 10 tons ha(-1) Y-1 in previous assessments. The energy content of potential biomass grown on 100% of abandoned agriculture lands is less than 10% of primary energy demand for most nations in North America, Europe, and Asia, but it represents many times the energy demand in some African nations where grasslands are relatively productive and current energy demand is low.","2008-08-01","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-05 17:53:11","","5791-5794","","15","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000258075100065","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\EDXWXIXE\Campbell et al. - 2008 - The global potential of bioenergy on abandoned agr.pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; Growth; Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"G7MZRWWM","report","2004","Rapp, Valerie","Western Forests, Fire Risk, and Climate Change","","","","","","Climate warming may first show up in forests as increased growth, which occurs as warmer temperatures, increased carbon dioxide, and more precipitation encourage higher rates of photosynthesis. The second way that climate change may show up in forests is through changes in disturbance regimes—the long-term patterns of fire, drought, insects, and diseases that are basic to forest development. Advanced computer models are producing the first national-scale simulations of how ecosystems and fire regimes could change in the 21st century. In six of seven future scenarios run through one model, the Western United States gets wetter winters and warmer summers throughout the 21st century (as compared to current climate), with expanded woody growth across the West and thus, increased fire risk. These results have been used in national and global assessments of global climate change. The computer model can now produce 7-month forecasts of possible fire risks for the conterminous United States, made possible by incorporating year-to-year changes in climate, fuel loadings, and moisture into the model. The accuracy of 2002 and 2003 forecasts has validated the model’s approach, suggesting it can eventually be a useful planning tool for fire managers. Research results were produced by scientists from the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest (PNW) Research Station, working with others from Oregon State University and from around the world.

"SEAQ83WW","report","2009","Mazza, Rhonda; Sands, Yasmeen","2009 Science Accomplishments of the Pacific Northwest Research Station","","","","","","Looking back, I see that 2009 was a year of hard work and celebration at the Pacific Northwest Research Station. The hard work by our scientists, technicians, administrative support staff, partners, and volunteers allowed us to continue generating information that is used by land managers and policymakers to address pressing questions about climate change, carbon accounting, fuel treatments, and more. For example, station scientists and collaborators developed a GIS-based system for downscaling commonly available gridded climate data to 100 meters. The Olympic National Forest used this new method to simulate effects of climate change across its complex, mountainous terrain. The station celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Forest Service experimental forest network. Experimental forests provide unique opportunities for long-term research, and the experiments conducted at these sites over the decades have yielded invaluable information about forest management and ecosystem processes. The station welcomed two new sites into the experimental forest network and decommissioned the inactive Young’s Bay Experimental Forest on Admiralty Island in southeast Alaska. It was replaced by Héen Latinee near Juneau, which is more accessible and has a higher potential for research among our own scientists and our university partners in Juneau. The second new site is the Olympic Experimental State Forest on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, a result of a new partnership between the station and the Washington Department of Natural Resources. We also celebrated the new Alaska Coastal Rainforest Center, a collaborative venture of the University of Alaska Southeast, University of Alaska Fairbanks, the station, the Forest Service’s Alaska Region, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Alaska Region, and the City and Borough of Juneau. The center, located in the Juneau Forestry Science Laboratory, will provide formal and informal education at the university and community school levels as well as professional training relating to coastal rain forest ecosystems. This year, the station received $13.4 million under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). This stimulus money is being used to fund nine projects, including the installation of energy-efficient windows at the Olympia Forestry Sciences Laboratory and new stream gauging equipment at the South Umpqua Experimental forest in Oregon. Another project will restore community ecosystems while promoting green jobs in the Puget Sound area. Other projects will yield valuable information about fish and aquatic habitat, fire and fuels, and how the forests of Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington are adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate changes. All these projects were selected based on their ability to create jobs and promote economic recovery, especially in those areas most impacted by the recession. These projects also will help the Forest Service achieve management practices that promote and provide clean air, clean water, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities. In 2009, the station completed a realignment process that began with an evaluation of the station’s ability to implement the strategic business plan, which, among other things, outlines our future research priorities and areas of emphasis. The net effect is six new research programs that optimize the station’s capacity to produce relevant, quality science and attract stakeholder support. With this new groundwork in place, I’m confident in our ability to do timely research with long-term value.","2009","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2019-10-08 18:38:15","","82","","","","","","","","","","Science Accomplishments","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\UF8CGZ5I\Mazza and Sands - 2009 - 2009 Science Accomplishments of the Pacific Northw.pdf","","Science Accomplishments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009 Science Accomplishments of the Pacific Northwest Research Station","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an observational study, the role of P and S in soil development was explored on a small knoll in the Wasatch subalpine summer range of central Utah that had been severely eroded during uncontrolled grazing in the late 1800s. Vegetation, litter, soil, and parent material were sampled along a transect across six strata forming highly visible narrow, concentric rings around the knoll. Even-numbered strata were characterized by large amounts of surface rock and sparse vegetative cover. Odd-numbered strata had less surface rock and visibly greater vegetative cover. Data for vegetation, litter, and soil surface properties displayed highly consistent peak and valley patterns for odd- and even-numbered strata with significant differences for 9 of 10 of these properties between the two strata groups. Organic C, potassium (K), and S of the parent material, and available N (Nav), P (Pav), and S (Sav) and exchangeable K (Kex) of the 0- to 15-cm soil layer also displayed peak and valley patterns. Multiple regression of herbage yield on Corg and S of soil parent material, and Pav and (Kex) of the solum gave high R2s of 0.94 and 0.93. Multiple regression of grass yield on Corg and Kex of the 0- to 15-cm soil layer had R2 = 0.95. Based on results, the hypothesis that P of the parent material has influenced soil and plant development of these strata was rejected. The data subtly suggest that sulfur may play a key role in the development of these soil-plant systems.

Down wood can serve as reservoirs for moisture and mycorrhizal fungi beneficial to the health and growth of commercial tree species. Decaying wood, leaf litter, small twigs, and roots contribute nutrients and structure to humus and soil organic matter, and host microbes that play beneficial roles in nitrogen cycles and other processes. Snags and down wood provide nurse functions for tree and shrub species, and can aid in restoration of degraded forest environments. Various elements of wood decay provide habitat for many species of wildlife including invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Fire can influence the amounts and distributions of wood decay elements and enhance or detract desired ecosystem processes, depending on severity, charring, soil temperature, and other factors. Managing wood decay elements for ecosystem processes entails better understanding decay dynamics, the role of coarse wood in soil, the role of wood decay in carbon cycling and sequestration, and other considerations.","2017-09","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 22:07:12","","40","","","","","","","","","","Research Note","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ALM9BLQ2\Marcot - 2017 - Ecosystem Processes Related to Wood Decay.pdf","","Processes; Research Note; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-RN-576","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Optimization of these two objectives will require a better understanding of how management regimes affect stand average wood density and carbon fraction. Two contrasting coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) sites were chosen for analysis of volume growth rates and tree stem carbon sequestration rates under two management systems - even-aged and multiaged - each with various treatments. A young plantation showed high volume increment and stem carbon sequestration rates in all treatments with the highest in the control plots. Control plots in the plantation had peak periodic volume increment of 75.6 m3 ha-1 year-1 and a maximum stem carbon sequestration rate of 16.08 tonnes C ha-1 year-1. The multiaged stand in contrast had the lowest volume and carbon increment in the control plots at 11.97 m3 ha-1 year-1 and 2.40 tonnes C ha-1 year-1, respectively. In both the management systems, significant differences were observed in the carbon fraction (mass carbon per unit mass dry wood) of heartwood (HW) and sapwood (SW) at 0.5385 and 0.5293, respectively, implying that increasing the ratio of HW to SW will result in higher average carbon fractions. Carbon density varied between management regimes with the highest values occurring in the multiaged stand indicating the potential for enhancement of carbon sequestration through silvicultural prescriptions. Utilization of standard carbon accounting practices resulted in a systematic underestimate of stand-level carbon stocks for both systems studied of 26 per cent in the even-aged stand and 27 per cent in the multiaged stand.","2012-01-01","2019-10-08 18:32:13","2021-03-02 23:19:30","2018-10-24 18:52:43","99-110","","1","85","","","Carbon density in managed coast redwood stands","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\XI9F2LPV\Jones and O'hara - 2012 - Carbon density in managed coast redwood stands im.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; California; Carbon fraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study provides the longest, continuous record of old-growth eddy flux data to date from one of the longest running Fluxnet stations in the world. From 1998 to 2013, average annual net ecosystem exchange (FNEE) at Wind River AmeriFlux was -32±84 g Cm-2 yr-1 indicating that the late seral forest is on average a small net sink of atmospheric carbon. However, interannual variability is high (>300 g Cm-2 yr-1) and shows that the stand switches from net carbon sink to source in response to climate drivers associated with ENSO. The old-growth forest is a much stronger sink during La Niña years (mean FNEE = -90 g Cm-2 yr-1) than during El Niño when the stand turns carbon neutral or into a small net carbon source (mean FNEE = +17 g Cm-2 yr-1). Forest inventory data dating back to the 1930s show a similar correlation with the lower frequency Pacific North American (PNA) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) whereby higher aboveground net primary productivity (FANPP) is associated with cool phases of both the PNA and PDO. These measurements add evidence that carbon exchange in old-growth stands may be more sensitive to climate variability across shorter time scales than once thought.","2016-04-01","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-03-03 18:19:51","2019-05-13 23:03:28","11","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QUVMZQIK\Wharton and Falk - 2016 - Climate indices strongly influence old-growth fore.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The core study relies on an ensemble of climate simulations under two emissions scenarios: a business-as-usual reference scenario (REF) analogous to the IPCC RCP8.5 scenario, and a greenhouse gas mitigation scenario, called POL3.7, which is in between the IPCC RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios, and is consistent with a 2 °C global mean warming from pre-industrial by 2100. Evaluating the outcomes of both climate change scenarios in the MC2 model shows that the carbon stocks of most forests around the world increased, with the greatest gains in tropical forest regions. Temperate forest regions are projected to see strong increases in productivity offset by carbon loss to ﬁre. The greatest cost of mitigation in terms of effects on forest carbon stocks are projected to be borne by regions in the southern hemisphere. We compare three sources of uncertainty in climate change impacts on the world’s forests: emissions scenarios, the global system climate response (i.e. climate sensitivity), and natural variability. The role of natural variability on changes in forest carbon and net primary productivity (NPP) is small, but it is substantial for impacts of wildﬁre. Forest productivity under the REF scenario beneﬁts substantially from the CO2 fertilization effect and that higher warming alone does not necessarily increase global forest carbon levels. Our analysis underlines why using an ensemble of climate simulations is necessary to derive robust estimates of the beneﬁts of greenhouse gas mitigation. It also demonstrates that constraining estimates of climate sensitivity and advancing our understanding of CO2 fertilization effects may considerably reduce the range of projections.","2017-04-01","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-07 17:43:08","2019-05-13 23:01:51","15","","4","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\WCWQRFVH\Kim et al. - 2017 - Assessing climate change impacts, benefits of miti.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The surface organic horizons insulate the deeper soil from variations in atmospheric temperature. The removal of these insulating horizons through consumption by fire increases the vulnerability of permafrost to thaw, and the carbon stored in permafrost to decomposition. In this study we ask how warming and fire regime may influence spatial and temporal changes in active layer and carbon dynamics across a boreal forest landscape in interior Alaska. To address this question, we (1) developed and tested a predictive model of the effect of fire severity on soil organic horizons that depends on landscape-level conditions and (2) used this model to evaluate the long-term consequences of warming and changes in fire regime on active layer and soil carbon dynamics of black spruce forests across interior Alaska. The predictive model of fire severity, designed from the analysis of field observations, reproduces the effect of local topography (landform category, the slope angle and aspect and flow accumulation), weather conditions (drought index, soil moisture) and fire characteristics (day of year and size of the fire) on the reduction of the organic layer caused by fire. The integration of the fire severity model into an ecosystem process-based model allowed us to document the relative importance and interactions among local topography, fire regime and climate warming on active layer and soil carbon dynamics. Lowlands were more resistant to severe fires and climate warming, showing smaller increases in active layer thickness and soil carbon loss compared to drier flat uplands and slopes. In simulations that included the effects of both warming and fire at the regional scale, fire was primarily responsible for a reduction in organic layer thickness of 0.06 m on average by 2100 that led to an increase in active layer thickness of 1.1 m on average by 2100. The combination of warming and fire led to a simulated cumulative loss of 9.6 kgC m-2 on average by 2100. Our analysis suggests that ecosystem carbon storage in boreal forests in interior Alaska is particularly vulnerable, primarily due to the combustion of organic layer thickness in fire and the related increase in active layer thickness that exposes previously protected permafrost soil carbon to decomposition.","2013-12-01","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-12-03 18:58:16","2019-05-13 23:08:51","13","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\SWVGQC3Q\Genet et al. - 2013 - Modeling the effects of fire severity and climate .pdf","","Fire; Modeling; Journal Article; Soil; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, recent studies have revealed increasing frequency and extent of wildfires, decreasing landscape greenness, increasing tree mortality and declining growth of black and white spruce in boreal North America. We measured ring widths from a large set of increment cores collected across a vast area of interior Alaska and examined implications of data processing decisions for apparent trends in black and white spruce growth. We found that choice of detrending method had important implications for apparent long-term growth trends and the strength of climate-growth correlations. Trends varied from strong increases in growth since the Industrial Revolution, when ring widths were detrended using single-curve regional curve standardization (RCS), to strong decreases in growth, when ring widths were normalized by fitting a horizontal line to each ring width series. All methods revealed a pronounced growth peak for black and white spruce centered near 1940. Most detrending methods showed a decline from the peak, leaving recent growth of both species near the long-term mean. Climate-growth analyses revealed negative correlations with growing season temperature and positive correlations with August precipitation for both species. Multiple-curve RCS detrending produced the strongest and/or greatest number of significant climate-growth correlations. Results provide important historical context for recent growth of black and white spruce. Growth of both species might decline with future warming, if not mitigated by increasing precipitation.

At present, the distribution of shore pine in Alaska is restricted to coastal bogs and fens, likely by competition with Sitka spruce and Western hemlock. Monitoring of permanent plots as part of the United States Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program identified a recent loss of shore pine biomass in Southeast Alaska. The apparent loss of shore pine is concerning, because its presence adds a vertical dimension to coastal wetlands, which are the richest plant communities of the coastal temperate rainforest in Alaska. In this study, we examined the shore pine tree-ring record from a newly established plot network throughout Southeast Alaska and explored climate-growth relationships. We found a steep decline in shore pine growth from the early 1960s to the present. Random Forest regression revealed a strong correlation between the decline in shore pine growth and the rise in growing season diurnal minimum air temperature. Warm summer nights, cool daytime temperatures and a reduced diurnal temperature range are associated with greater cloud cover in Southeast Alaska. This suite of conditions could lead to unfavorable tree carbon budgets (reduced daytime photosynthesis and greater nighttime respiration) and/or favor infection by foliar pathogens, such as Dothistroma needle blight, which has recently caused widespread tree mortality on lodgepole pine plantations in British Columbia. Further field study that includes experimental manipulation (e.g., fungicide application) will be necessary to identify the proximal cause(s) of the growth decline.

In this paper we present the first comprehensive synthesis of climate-change impacts on all forested ecosystems of Alaska, highlighting changes in the most critical biophysical factors of each region. We developed a conceptual framework describing climate drivers, biophysical factors and types of change to illustrate how the biophysical and social subsystems of Alaskan forests interact and respond directly and indirectly to a changing climate. We then identify the regional and global implications to the climate system and associated socio-economic impacts, as presented in the current literature. Projections of temperature and precipitation suggest wildfire will continue to be the dominant biophysical factor in the Interior-boreal forest, leading to shifts from conifer- to deciduous-dominated forests. Based on existing research, projected increases in temperature in the Southcentral- and Kenai-boreal forests will likely increase the frequency and severity of insect outbreaks and associated wildfires, and increase the probability of establishment by invasive plant species. In the Coastal-temperate forest region snow and ice is regarded as the dominant biophysical factor. With continued warming, hydrologic changes related to more rapidly melting glaciers and rising elevation of the winter snowline will alter discharge in many rivers, which will have important consequences for terrestrial and marine ecosystem productivity. These climate-related changes will affect plant species distribution and wildlife habitat, which have regional societal consequences, and trace-gas emissions and radiation budgets, which are globally important. Our conceptual framework facilitates assessment of current and future consequences of a changing climate, emphasizes regional differences in biophysical factors, and points to linkages that may exist but that currently lack supporting research. The framework also serves as a visual tool for resource managers and policy makers to develop regional and global management strategies and to inform policies related to climate mitigation and adaptation.","2011-11","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-14 15:50:54","2019-05-13 23:05:36","35","","11","2","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\UMCSTBJX\Wolken et al. - 2011 - Evidence and implications of recent and projected .pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Alaska; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Until now we have been unable to test whether production and decomposition are generally coupled across climatically dissimilar regions, because we lacked replicated data collected within a single vegetation type across multiple regions, obfuscating the drivers and generality of the association between production and decomposition. Furthermore, our understanding of the relationships between production and decomposition rests heavily on separate meta-analyses of each response, because no studies have simultaneously measured production and the accumulation or decomposition of litter using consistent methods at globally relevant scales. Here, we use a multi-country grassland dataset collected using a standardized protocol to show that live plant biomass (an estimate of aboveground net primary production) and litter disappearance (represented by mass loss of aboveground litter) do not strongly covary. Live biomass and litter disappearance varied at different spatial scales. There was substantial variation in live biomass among continents, sites and plots whereas among continent differences accounted for most of the variation in litter disappearance rates. Although there were strong associations among aboveground biomass, litter disappearance and climatic factors in some regions (e.g. U.S. Great Plains), these relationships were inconsistent within and among the regions represented by this study. These results highlight the importance of replication among regions and continents when characterizing the correlations between ecosystem processes and interpreting their global-scale implications for carbon flux.

Crown biomass estimation is useful for different purposes including evaluating the economic feasibility of crown utilization for energy production or forest products, fuel load assessments and fire management strategies, and wildfire modeling. However, crown biomass is difficult to predict because of the variability within and among species and sites. Thus the allometric equations used for predicting crown biomass should be based on data collected with precise and unbiased sampling strategies. In this study, we evaluate the performance different sampling strategies to estimate crown biomass and to evaluate the effect of sample size in estimating crown biomass. Methods: Using data collected from 20 destructively sampled trees, we evaluated 11 different sampling strategies using six evaluation statistics: bias, relative bias, root mean square error (RMSE), relative RMSE, amount of biomass sampled, and relative biomass sampled. We also evaluated the performance of the selected sampling strategies when different numbers of branches (3, 6, 9, and 12) are selected from each tree. Tree specific log linear model with branch diameter and branch length as covariates was used to obtain individual branch biomass. Results: Compared to all other methods stratified sampling with probability proportional to size estimation technique produced better results when three or six branches per tree were sampled. However, the systematic sampling with ratio estimation technique was the best when at least nine branches per tree were sampled. Under the stratified sampling strategy, selecting unequal number of branches per stratum produced approximately similar results to simple random sampling, but it further decreased RMSE when information on branch diameter is used in the design and estimation phases. Conclusions: Use of auxiliary information in design or estimation phase reduces the RMSE produced by a sampling strategy. However, this is attained by having to sample larger amount of biomass. Based on our finding we would recommend sampling nine branches per tree to be reasonably efficient and limit the amount of fieldwork.","2015-12","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-08 18:20:13","2019-05-13 23:05:33","11","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\F2S9ZMPJ\Poudel et al. - 2015 - Evaluation of sampling strategies to estimate crow.pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

National forest inventories provide strong, measurement- based constraints on the magnitude of net forest carbon uptake. We brought together forest sector C budgets for Canada, the United States, Europe, Russia, and China that were derived from forest inventory information, allometric relationships, and supplementary data sets and models. Together, these suggest that northern forests and woodlands provided a total sink for 0.6–0.7 Pg of C per year (1 Pg 5 1015 g) during the early 1990s, consisting of 0.21 Pg C/yr in living biomass, 0.08 Pg C/yr in forest products, 0.15 Pg C/ yr in dead wood, and 0.13 Pg C/yr in the forest floor and soil organic matter. Estimates of changes in soil C pools have improved but remain the least certain terms of the budgets. Over 80% of the estimated sink occurred in one-third of the forest area, in temperate regions affected by fire suppression, agricultural abandonment, and plantation forestry. Growth in boreal regions was offset by fire and other disturbances that vary considerably from year to year. Comparison with atmospheric inversions suggests significant land C sinks may occur outside the forest sector.","2002","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-12-03 19:01:27","","891-899","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ZPKXCYKV\Goodale et al. - 2002 - Forest Carbon Sinks in the Northern Hemisphere.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this version, the plant classification is specifically adapted to best represent Miocene European vegetation. Compared to other plant classifications used in global models, this adapted classification is more refined, since it is specifically developed for European vegetation and it includes various thermophylous tree types, which were present in Europe during the Miocene. The corresponding climatic tolerance parameters are based on the study of Laurent et al. (Journal of Vegetation Science, 15, 739-746, 2004) for the tree types currently present in Europe and on the distribution of analogue species in southeastern Asia and North/Central America for the thermophylous (sub-tropical) trees. The same classification is used to characterize the palaeoflora at the available Late Miocene localities, allowing a model–data comparison at the plant functional type level, rather than at the biome level. The climatic inputs to CARAIB are obtained from the COSMOS atmosphere–ocean general circulation model. The climatic anomalies (Tortonian minus Present) derived from COSMOS are interpolated to a higher spatial resolution before being used in the vegetation model. These anomalies are combined with a modern climatology to produce climatic fields with high spatial resolution (10 × 10 ft). This procedure has the advantage of making apparent relief features smaller than the grid cells of the climate model and, hence, makes easier the comparison with local vegetation data, although it does not really improve the quality of the Tortonian climate reconstruction. The new version of CARAIB was run over Europe at this higher spatial resolution. It calculates the potential distribution of 13 different classes of trees (including cold/cool/warm-temperate, subtropical and tropical types), together with their cover fractions, net primary productivities and biomasses. The resulting model vegetation distribution reconstructed for the Tortonian is compared to available palaeovegetation and pollen data. Before performing this comparison, the tree taxa present at the various data sites are assigned to one or several model classes, depending on the identification level of the taxa. If several classes are possible for a taxon, only those that can co-exist with the other tree classes identified at the site are retained. This methodology is similar to the co-existence approach used in palaeoclimatic reconstructions based on vegetation data. It narrows the range of tree types present at the various sites, by suppressing in the data the extreme types, such as the cold boreal/temperate and tropical trees. The method allows a comparison with the model simulation on a presence/absence basis. This comparison provides an overall agreement of 53% between the model and the data, when all sites and tree types are considered. The agreement is high (N85%) for needle-leaved summergreen boreal/temperate cold trees (Larix sp.) and for tropical trees, intermediate (N40%) for other boreal/temperate cold trees and for needle-leaved evergreen temperate cool trees, broadleaved summergreen temperate cool trees and broadleaved evergreen warmtemperate trees, and poor (b40%) for most temperate perhumid warm trees. In many cases, the model is shown to be better at predicting the absence than the presence, as observed for tropical trees. The modelled distributions of cold boreal/temperate trees tend to extend too much towards the south compared to the data. By contrast, model sub-tropical trees (temperate perhumid warm and needle-leaf summergreen temperate warm trees) appear to be restricted to some limited areas in southern Europe, while they are present in the data from central Europe up to at least 50°N. Consequently, modelled Late Miocene climate  appears to remain too cold to produce assemblages of trees consistent with the data. The predicted modelled trends from the past to the present are in the right direction, but the amplitude remains too small. For the simulations to be in a better agreement with the data, higher CO2 levels may be necessary in the climate simulations, or possibly other oceanic boundary conditions may be required, such as different bathymetry in the Panama seaway.","2011","2020-03-30 17:57:40","2021-02-23 01:41:45","","359-378","","","304","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>CARAIB</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\9CTSUIV3\Francois et al. - 2011 - Modelling Late Miocene vegetation in Europe Resul.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When forests are actively managed, treatments can alter forests carbon dynamics, reducing their sink strength and switching them from sinks to sources of carbon. These effects are generally characterized by fast temporal dynamics. Hence this study monitored for over a decade the impacts of management practices commonly used to reduce fire hazards on the carbon dynamics of mixed-conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Soil CO2 efflux, carbon pools (i.e. soil carbon, litter, fine roots, tree biomass), and radial tree growth were compared among un-manipulated controls, prescribed fire, thinning, thinning followed by fire, and two clear-cut harvested sites. Soil CO2 efflux was reduced by both fire and harvesting (ca. 15%). Soil carbon content (upper 15 cm) was not significantly changed by harvest or fire treatments. Fine root biomass was reduced by clear-cut harvest (60–70%) but not by fire, and the litter layer was reduced 80% by clear-cut harvest and 40% by fire. Thinning effects on tree growth and biomass were concentrated in the first year after treatments, whereas fire effects persisted over the seven-year post-treatment period. Over this period, tree radial growth was increased (25%) by thinning and reduced (12%) by fire. After seven years, tree biomass returned to pre-treatment levels in both fire and thinning treatments; however, biomass and productivity decreased 30%-40% compared to controls when thinning was combined with fire. The clear-cut treatment had the strongest impact, reducing ecosystem carbon stocks and delaying the capacity for carbon uptake. We conclude that post-treatment carbon dynamics and ecosystem recovery time varied with intensity and type of treatments. Consequently, management practices can be selected to minimize ecosystem carbon losses while increasing future carbon uptake, resilience to high severity fire, and climate related stresses.","2016-02-26","2020-02-07 19:00:00","2021-12-07 19:15:34","2020-02-07 19:00:00","e0150256","","2","11","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\9D5TRMYV\Dore et al. - 2016 - Management Impacts on Carbon Dynamics in a Sierra .pdf","","Management; Pools; Journal Article; Flux; California; WD","","Hui, Dafeng","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet modeling studies indicate the importance of climate effects on disturbance regimes (He et al. 1999). Local, regional, and global changes in temperature and precipitation can influence the occurrence, timing, frequency, duration, extent, and intensity of disturbances (Baker 1995, Turner et al. 1998).

A general model is developed to relate average carbon storage over the lifetime of a forest managed for sustained yeild to maximum biomass of the same forest at maturity. Point of inflection of stand growth is established using Richards function. If a forest is manaed for maximum sustained yeild of biomass, mean lifetime carbon storage is about one-third that at maturity. Point of growth inflection has little effect on this fraction. When accumulation and decomposition of detritus after harvest are added, the fraction is about 0.5 in temperate deciduous forests, less in the tropics, and more in boreal forests. Harvest at financial maturity, by shortening the rotation, disproportianately reduces lifetime carbon storage, to perhaps 0.2 of the maximum. Nontimber values may affect carbon storage either positively or negatively. Forest regrowth and multispecies agricultural systems that includde trees may account for more carbon storage in the tropics than is sometimes assumed.","1983","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-05 19:04:05","","155-166","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1983QE78500022","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\HP2AYJ7T\Cooper - 1983 - Carbon storage in managed forests.pdf","","Management; Pools; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Activities to sequester C in croplands included land conversion, land restoration, improved cropping systems, and intensified management using conservation tillage and improved water and fertility management. Lal et al. (1998) estimated that cropland soils could sequester 75 to 208 million metric tons C per year (Mt C / year) (mean = 142), while 43 Mt C/year was estimated to be emitted from production inputs. Thus, the net potential sequestration was estimated at 100 Mt C/year on a cropland area of 136.6 million hecatares (Mha) (Lal et al. 1998). Activities to sequester C in grazing lands included controlling soil erosion losses, restoring eroded and degraded soils, land conversion, and improved pasture and rangeland management, which involved fertility management, planting improved species, and grazing management. The overall potential of U.S. grazing lands to sequester C ranged from 29.5 to 110 Mt C/year (mean =69.8) during a 25-year period, with emission losses of 12.0 to 19.5 Mt C/year (mean =15.8).

Simulations of 10,000-50,000 years were performed using artificial weather sequences generated by time-series analysis of recorded ERC values at local weather stations. Also needed were monthly distributions of wind speed and direction, as well as spatial data on fuel and topography. Fire suppression was represented by a model of the probability of fire containment by suppression forces, based on fire growth rates, days since ignition, and fuel type. Simulated values of burn probability generally fell within a factor of three of observed values. At the pixel level, burn probabilities vary markedly based on differences in fuels, weather, and topography. The slope of the frequency-magnitude distribution of simulated fire sizes was compared to historic records in each region, demonstrating that the model produced fire size distributions similar to historic patterns. Because model parameters included only a limited suite of weather, fuel, and suppression variables, this result is interpreted to mean that observed fire size distributions are a function of the joint distributions of spatial opportunities for fires to grow to different sizes (dependent on fuels and ignition location) and temporal variability in the length of weather sequences conducive to fire growth. A contribution of this research is the practical aspect of performing fire simulations at national scales for operational planning and ecological research.","2010","2020-04-22 22:28:11","2020-10-06 20:11:00","","12","","","VI International Conference on Forest Fire Research, D.X.

"KCTLUQTY","report","2010","Daigle, Patrick W; Dymond, Caren C","The Carbon Conundrum  - Fire and Fuel Management in Fire-prone Forests","","","","","","Natural resource managers face a conundrum: when do fire management activities increase sources or sinks of greenhouse gases? This extension note describes forest carbon (C) dynamics and approaches for dealing with carbon stocks and flows while managing for fire and a full range of natural resource values. In addressing climate change, we need to understand the relationships between fire management and carbon emissions and storage. Our focus is on fire-prone dry forests such as those in the British Columbia (B.C.) southcentral interior. Carbon dioxide (CO2), one of the greenhouse gases, contributes to climate change. When forests burn and decompose, they emit CO2. Natural and human-caused fires ignite each summer. In many dry B.C. ecosystems, fire has been a natural ecosystem process. In these settings, fire provides many benefits: reducing fuel hazards, creating diverse ecosystems and habitats that support large numbers of species, enhancing soil nutrients, helping keep insects and pathogens in check, and taking up and storing carbon. Over recent decades in western North America, spring and summer temperature increases along with earlier snowmelts have been documented; this has contributed to longer fire seasons, more large wildfires, and fires of greater duration.1 A southern interior B.C. study concludes that larglonger fire seasons may increase fire weather severity, risk of ignitions, and fire behaviour severity.2 These circumstances challenge land and resource managers dealing with fire as well as those addressing climate change and carbon flows and stocks. Carbon is cycled from the atmosphere into the forest through photosynthesis by converting CO2 into the components of wood. When trees die, the wood, foliage, and roots decompose. Some of the carbon is released as CO2 gas, and other forms become part of the forest floor and soil. During a forest fire, combustion of wood and the forest floor rapidly releases CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide gases, all of which contribute to climate change.3 Forests play a major role in the global C cycle. Stored C in live biomass, dead plant material, and soils represents the balance between absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and releasing it through respiration, decomposition, and burning.4 Over time and across landscapes, forests release CO2 (e.g., due to fire and insect mortality) (Figure 1). At the same time, unburned forests across the landscape (and areas regenerating after fires) take in CO2 from the atmosphere as they grow. Basically, forests actively recycle CO2. Note that the use of fossil fuels releases CO2 (and other gases) - however, underground deposits of coal, gas, methane, and oil have no such capacity for taking in atmospheric CO2. This means that CO2 from combustion of fossil fuels is the main contributor to greenhouse gases and climate change, not CO2 from biological sources. Aside from forests naturally recycling CO2, fire management activities may add greenhouse gas emissions or enhance the uptake and storage of CO2. All fuel reduction treatments emit carbon; for example, thinning a stand results in slash, which then either decomposes or is reduced by controlled burns.5 In addition, onthe- ground actions (e.g., skidding and hauling thinned merchantable timber) create fossil fuel emissions.6 Fire suppression actions also emit greenhouse gases through fossil fuel use in aircraft, trucks, pumps, etc.","2010","2020-01-21 19:54:55","2021-03-02 23:04:04","","8","","","","","","","","","","","B.C.

"TRAHDKJB","report","2012","Dymond, Caren C","Our Logs’ Story from Truck to Product","","","","","","Industry and government agencies are looking to diversify the mix of products from British Columbia’s timber harvest as part of industry renewal and to improve sector competitiveness. To get the greatest value from every tree, we need to understand the current and historical use of logs, the supply and demand dynamics of different products, and the supply of wood fibre for potential new uses. However, there are conflicting estimates of the amount of fibre available from mill or harvest residues. There is one estimate of 6.5 million tonnes production of mill residues in 2004, with 1.8 million tonnes per year surplus.1 A different study estimated 9.3 million tonnes per year production of mill residues in British Columbia.2 An older study estimated 7.9 million tonnes of wood and pulp residues, of which 2.2 million was surplus.3 Traditionally, trees, logs, and different products have been measured in unique units, such as board feet for lumber, square feet for plywood, or gigajoules (GJ) for energy. In this report, we include the traditional units and a common metric of tonnes of ovendry biomass. Biomass is the weight of organic material, be it wood or paper. It varies for different volumes of wood depending on the density and moisture content. Price provides a good example of a common metric that allows comparison across product lines. By using biomass as a common metric, we can follow the fibre in a log from the hauling truck through different types of mills and into various products. We can use this information to assess efficiency and opportunities for higher-value or longer-lived products. We can also attribute a value (e.g., price per tonne of biomass) to help inform us on the optimal use of wood. For example, does an increase in the total value of forest products indicate that more biomass was used or that the price of one or several products increased? Because we know how much biomass is harvested from British Columbia’s forests each year, the sum total of the products and waste should add up to the same amount. If they do not add up, then we can use that information to identify gaps in our data and opportunities to improve our knowledge of the forestry sector.","2012","2020-01-21 19:55:26","2021-03-01 23:41:02","","6","","","","","","","","","","","B.C.

Simultaneously, preserving and enhancing structural, functional, and species diversity in forests remains an important objective. Therefore, understanding tradeoffs and synergies among C storage and sequestration and diversity in managed forests is key to achieving these multiple objectives. Using the experimental framework of the Density Management Study in western Oregon, we examined the relationships among a suite of thinning treatments, above-ground carbon stocks, and understory vascular plant species richness. Six years following treatment implementation, total above-ground C declined with residual density. Total aboveground C in the high-density thinning treatment (300 trees ha-1) did not differ statistically from the untreated control treatment (~370–775 trees ha-1), and these two treatments stored 33 percent and 61 percent more C above ground, respectively, than the moderate density (200 trees ha-1) and variable density (300, 200, 100 trees ha-1) treatments. Differences among treatments were primarily related to reductions in the live overstory pool. For all treatments, C stored in the live overstory > large down wood > snags > stumps > small down wood. Coarse down wood (CDW) comprised over 30 percent of the total above-ground C storage. Most of the C in the dead pools appears to be legacy (pre-thinning) material; 50–95 percent of snags, stumps, and large down wood were in intermediate to late stages of decomposition. Between years 6 and 11 post-treatment, the overstory C increment tended to decline with lower residual density, although this trend was not statistically significant. In contrast, understory plant species richness was greater in all thinning treatments than in untreated controls. Relationships varied slightly among treatments. Moderateand variable-density thinning treatments resulted in a negative relationship between understory plant species richness and above-ground C, while no relationship was observed in the high-density treatment and unthinned control. Results suggest that thinning increases plant species richness, implying that there is a trade-off between management for understory plant species richness and above-ground C storage.","2013","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2021-03-02 23:17:12","","91-100","","","","","","","","","","General Technical Report","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","Portland, OR","en","","Government publication","","","Zotero","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\6ASF7E8B\Burton et al. - 2013 - Above-ground Carbon Storage, Down Wood, and Unders.pdf","","Management; Pools; GTR; Oregon; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PNW-GTR-880","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For three climatically diverse landscapes, simulations were used to explore the change in species composition and tree growth that should accompany climate change during the 21st century. The simulations illustrated the changes in forest composition that could accompany climate change. Projections were the most sensitive to mortality, as the loss of trees of a dominant species heavily influenced stand dynamics.

Prescribed burning and timber harvesting are two common, co-occurring, forest management practices that may alter forest carbon pools. Prescribed burning for forest management, such as wildfire risk reduction, may shorten inter-fire intervals and potentially reduce carbon stocks. Timber harvesting may further increase the susceptibility of forest carbon to losses in response to frequent burning regimes by redistributing carbon stocks from the live pools into the dead pools, causing mechanical damage to retained trees and shifting the demography of tree communities. We used a 27-yr experiment in a temperate eucalypt forest to examine the effect of prescribed burning frequency and timber harvesting on aboveground carbon (AGC). Total AGC was reduced by similar to 23% on harvested plots when fire frequency increased from zero to seven fires, but was not affected by fire frequency on unharvested plots. The reduction in total AGC associated with increasing fire frequency on harvested plots was driven by declines in large coarse woody debris (>= 10 cm diameter) and large trees (>= 20 cm diameter). Small tree (DBH) AGC increased with fire frequency on harvested plots, but decreased on unharvested plots. Carbon in dead standing trees decreased with increasing fire frequency on unharvested plots, but was unaffected on harvested plots. Small coarse woody debris (<10 cm diameter) was largely unaffected by fire frequency and harvesting. Total AGC on harvested plots was between 67% and 82% of that on unharvested plots, depending on burning treatment. Our results suggest that AGC in historically harvested forests may be susceptible to declines in response to increases in prescribed burning frequency. Consideration of historic harvesting will be important in understanding the effect of prescribed burning programs on forest carbon budgets.","2019-01","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2021-12-07 19:01:15","","UNSP e01815","","1","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000454685500005","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\FG947HVX\Collins et al. - 2019 - Aboveground forest carbon shows different response.pdf","","Fire; Management; Pools; Journal Article; Harvest; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We review seven priority ES identified from UK land and forestry strategy and policy documents: timber/biomass production, carbon storage, biodiversity, health and recreation, water supply and quality and flood protection. We present a synthesis of the impact of management on relative ES supply. It shows that low intensity management is unsuitable for high biomass production, yet provides high or moderately high levels of other services. Higher intensity management impacts negatively on biodiversity, health and recreation and water supply services. Combined objective forestry provides high or moderately high levels for all services except biomass. We recommend that a diversity of management approaches is needed to maintain multiple ecosystem service provision.

We examine the evidence for carbon beneﬁts, environmental and monetary costs, risks and trade-offs for a variety of activities in three general strategies: (1) land use change to increase forest area (afforestation) and avoid deforestation; (2) carbon management in existing forests; and (3) the use of wood as biomass energy, in place of other building materials, or in wood products for carbon storage. We found that many strategies can increase forest sector carbon mitigation above the current 162–256 Tg C/yr, and that many strategies have co-benefits such as biodiversity, water, and economic opportunities. Each strategy also has trade-offs, risks, and uncertainties including possible leakage, permanence, disturbances, and climate change effects. Because ~60% of the carbon lost through deforestation and harvesting from 1700 to 1935 has not yet been recovered and because some strategies store carbon in forest products or use biomass energy, the biological potential for forest sector carbon mitigation is large. Several studies suggest that using these strategies could offset as much as 10–20% of current U.S. fossil fuel emissions. To obtain such large offsets in the United States would require a combination of afforesting up to one-third of cropland or pastureland, using the equivalent of about one-half of the gross annual forest growth for biomass energy, or implementing more intensive management to increase forest growth on one-third of forestland. Such large offsets would require substantial trade-offs, such as lower agricultural production and non-carbon ecosystem services from forests. The effectiveness of activities could be diluted by negative leakage effects and increasing disturbance regimes. Because forest carbon loss contributes to increasing climate risk and because climate change may impede regeneration following disturbance, avoiding deforestation and promoting regeneration after disturbance should receive high priority as policy considerations. Policies to encourage programs or projects that influence forest carbon sequestration and offset fossil fuel emissions should also consider major items such as leakage, the cyclical nature of forest growth and regrowth, and the extensive demand for and movement of forest products globally, and other greenhouse gas effects, such as methane and nitrous oxide emissions, and recognize other environmental benefits of forests, such as biodiversity, nutrient management, and watershed protection. Activities that contribute to helping forests adapt to the effects of climate change, and which also complement forest carbon storage strategies, would be prudent.","2011-09","2019-12-02 18:35:17","2021-12-07 18:50:22","2019-12-02 18:35:17","1902-1924","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\2DMEKNT4\McKinley et al. - 2011 - A synthesis of current knowledge on forests and ca.pdf","","Biomass; Pools; Journal Article; Land use; Fuel wood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) to afforestation in deep soil layers is still poorly understood. We surveyed previously published literature for changes in deep SOC (defined as at least 10 cm deeper than the 0-10 cm layer) after afforestation of croplands and grasslands (total 63 sites from 56 literature), in order to examine changes in deep SOC and quantify the relationship between SOC change rates in topsoil and subsoil. The results of the meta analysis indicated that the responses of SOC to afforestation were opposite for cropland than grassland. The SOC in soil depth layers of 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60 and 60-80 cm were reduced with afforestation of grassland but not significantly (p > 0.05), while conversion of cropland to forests (trees or shrubs) increased SOC significantly for each soil depth layer up to 60 cm depth (p < 0.05). Significant relationships of SOC change rate were found between topsoil (0-20 cm) and deeper soil layers (20-40 and 40-60 cm). The linear regression showed that SOC change rate in 0-40 cm, 0-60 cm, and 0-100 cm soil profiles was 1.33, 1.49, and 1.55 times greater, respectively than the change rates in the corresponding 0-20 cm depth profile. Partial correlation analysis revealed that stand age and initial SOC content were determinants of deep soil SOC change after afforestation of agricultural soils. This study also showed that the O horizon can play an important role in carbon sequestration after afforestation of agricultural sites. We concluded that subsoil carbon must be taken into account when evaluating of SOC change with afforestation and, therefore, recommended that the soil sampling depth for afforested soils be set to at least 60 cm in mineral soils and include the O horizon. However, due to poor study designs and lack of standardized sampling protocols in the literature, these results were high in uncertainty. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this work was to evaluate forest sector climate change mitigation scenarios from 2018 to 2050 by applying a systems-based approach that accounts for net emissions across four interdependent components: (1) forest ecosystem, (2) land-use change, (3) harvested wood products, and (4) substitution benefits from using wood products and bioenergy. We assessed a range of land management and harvested wood product scenarios for two case studies in the U.S: coastal South Carolina and Northern Wisconsin. We integrated forest inventory and remotely-sensed disturbance data within a modelling framework consisting of a growth-and-yield driven ecosystem carbon model; a harvested wood products model that estimates emissions from commodity production, use and post-consumer treatment; and displacement factors to estimate avoided fossil fuel emissions. We estimated biophysical mitigation potential by comparing net emissions from land management and harvested wood products scenarios with a baseline ('business as usual') scenario. Results: Baseline scenario results showed that the strength of the ecosystem carbon sink has been decreasing in the two sites due to age-related productivity declines and deforestation. Mitigation activities have the potential to lessen or delay the further reduction in the carbon sink. Results of the mitigation analysis indicated that scenarios reducing net forest area loss were most effective in South Carolina, while extending harvest rotations and increasing longer-lived wood products were most effective in Wisconsin. Scenarios aimed at increasing bioenergy use either increased or reduced net emissions within the 32-year analysis timeframe. Conclusions: It is critical to apply a systems approach to comprehensively assess net emissions from forest sector climate change mitigation scenarios. Although some scenarios produced a benefit by displacing emissions from fossil fuel energy or by substituting wood products for other materials, these benefits can be outweighed by increased carbon emissions in the forest or product systems. Maintaining forests as forests, extending rotations, and shifting commodities to longer-lived products had the strongest mitigation benefits over several decades. Carbon cycle impacts of bioenergy depend on timeframe, feedstocks, and alternative uses of biomass, and cannot be assumed carbon neutral.","2018-09-04","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-06 16:39:50","","UNSP 13","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000449966400002","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\9QR8FWK2\Dugan et al. - 2018 - A systems approach to assess climate change mitiga.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Wood products; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this paper is to critically review the carbon sequestration cost studies of the past dozen years that have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the forestry option. Several conclusions emerge. While carbon sequestration cost studies all contain essentially the same components they are not comparable on their face due to the inconsistent use of terms, geographic scope, assumptions, program definitions, and methods. For example, there are at least three distinct definitions for a 'ton of carbon' that in turn lead to significantly different meanings for the metric 'dollars per ton of carbon'. This difference in carbon accounting further complicates comparison of studies. After adjusting for the variation among the studies. it appears that carbon sequestration may play a substantial role in a global greenhouse gas emissions abatement program. In the cost range of 10 to 150 dollars per ton of carbon it may be possible to sequester 250 to 500 million tons per year in the United States, and globally upwards of 2,000 million tons per year, for several decades. However, there are two unresolved issues that may seriously affect the contribution of carbon sequestration to a greenhouse gas mitigation program, and they will likely have counteracting effects. First, the secondary benefits of agricultural land conversion to forests may be as great as the costs. If that is the case, then the unit costs essentially disappear, making carbon sequestration a no-regrets strategy. In the other direction, if leakage is a serious issue at both the national and international levels, as suggested by some studies, then it may occur that governments will expend billions of dollars in subsidies or other forms of incentives, with little or no net gain in carbon, forests or secondary benefits. Preliminary results suggest that market interactions in carbon sequestration program analyses require considerably more attention. This is especially true for interactions between the forest and agricultural land markets and between the wood product sink and the timber markets.","2004-03","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-08 19:35:18","","1-48","","1-2","63","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000220005200001","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\KX9JAGZI\Richards and Stokes - 2004 - A review of forest carbon sequestration cost studi.pdf","","Journal Article; Sequestration; Economics; Offset","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using standardized data from the North American Carbon Program we compare observed and simulated monthly CO2 exchange from 44 eddy covariance flux towers in North America and 22 terrestrial biosphere models. The analysis period spans about 220 site-years, 10 biomes, and includes two large-scale drought events, providing a natural experiment to evaluate model skill as a function of drought and seasonality. We evaluate models’ ability to simulate the seasonal cycle of CO2 exchange using multiple model skill metrics and analyze links between model characteristics, site history, and model skill. Overall model performance was poor; the difference between observations and simulations was about 10 times observational uncertainty, with forested ecosystems better predicted than nonforested. Model-data agreement was highest in summer and in temperate evergreen forests. In contrast, model performance declined in spring and fall, especially in ecosystems with large deciduous components, and in dry periods during the growing season. Models used across multiple biomes and sites, the mean model ensemble, and a model using assimilated parameter values showed high consistency with observations. Models with the highest skill across all biomes all used prescribed canopy phenology, calculated NEE as the difference between GPP and ecosystem respiration, and did not use a daily time step.","2010","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-03-03 22:48:25","","G00H05, 22 p","","","115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\B6BSMMB9\Schwalm et al. - 2010 - A Model-data Intercomparison of CO2 Exchange Acros.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, finding a subset among numerous physical parameters in numerical models in the atmospheric and oceanic sciences, which are relatively more sensitive and important parameters, and reducing the errors in the physical parameters in this subset would be a far more efficient way to reduce the uncertainties involved in simulations. In this context, we present a new approach based on the conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation related to parameter (CNOP-P) method. The approach provides a framework to ascertain the subset of those relatively more sensitive and important parameters among the physical parameters. The Lund–Potsdam–Jena (LPJ) dynamical global vegetation model was utilized to test the validity of the new approach in China. The results imply that nonlinear interactions among parameters play a key role in the identification of sensitive parameters in arid and semi-arid regions of China compared to those in northern, northeastern, and southern China. The uncertainties in the numerical simulations were reduced considerably by reducing the errors of the subset of relatively more sensitive and important parameters. The results demonstrate that our approach not only offers a new route to identify relatively more sensitive and important physical parameters but also that it is viable to then apply “target observations” to reduce the uncertainties in model parameters.","2016","2020-04-16 20:46:24","2020-10-09 23:13:56","","587–601","","","128","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>LPJ</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\TVV2D3KE\Sun and Mu - 2016 - A new approach to identify the sensitivity and imp.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used systematic review methodology to identify and synthesize effects of thinning and/or burning, timber harvesting, clear-cut, and wildfire on four components of ecosystem carbon: aboveground vegetation, soil, litter, and deadwood. We performed a meta-analysis on studies from the United States and Canada because those represented 85% of the studies conducted worldwide. We found that the most important variables in predicting effect sizes (ratio of carbon stored in treated stands versus controls) were, in decreasing order of importance, ecosystem carbon component, time since treatment, and age of control. Management treatment was the least important of all the variables we examined, but the trends we found suggest that thinning and/or burning treatments resulted in less carbon loss than wildfire or clear-cut. This finding is consistent with recent modeling studies indicating that forest management is unimportant to long-term carbon dynamics relative to the effects of large-scale natural disturbances (e.g., drought, fire, pest outbreak). However, many data gaps still exist on total ecosystem carbon, particularly in regions other than North America, and in timber production forests and plantations.","2016","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2021-12-07 19:17:41","","311-323","","5","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000381803900001","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\U37Y42E2\Kalies et al. - 2016 - A meta-analysis of management effects on forest ca.pdf","","Management; Pools; Journal Article; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Monte Carlo (MC) simulations offer a practical, empirical method of accounting for potential map errors in broader ecosystem assessments. However, unless steps are taken across simulations to vary the probability density functions (PDFs) that control simulated map error, the large number of map units to which those PDFs are applied may cause convergence of mean simulated conditions and an artificial reduction of MC estimates of uncertainty. For MC simulation of errors in categorical maps, we introduce a technique we call “PDF weaving” which both: 1) allows variation of PDFs across simulations; and, 2) explicitly aligns the resulting range of simulated populations with estimates and uncertainties identified by traditional monitoring methods such as design-based inventories. This approach is based on solving systems of linear equations and inequalities for each simulation. Each system incorporates linear constraints related to the unchanging distribution of area among classes in the original map (akin to the fixed longitudinal “warp” on a loom) with variable linear constraints related to the class distribution to be simulated in any one iteration (analogous to the perpendicular, variable fibers of the “weft”). Additional constraints specify how many map units to treat as “correct” based on validation exercises at the map unit level. Solution of these systems provides PDFs which will simulate error at both the map unit level and the population level in a way that is consistent with validation exercises and available population-level estimates. We illustrated this approach in an assessment of the effects of wildfire and harvest on carbon storage over 20 years on a forested landscape in the western United States (US). This assessment utilized the Forest Carbon Management Framework (ForCaMF) approach, which is being implemented by the US National Forest System (NFS). Results showed that simulating map error through the use of dynamic PDFs can contribute significant, realistic uncertainty in a Monte Carlo analysis, but that impacts of fire and harvest on carbon storage may nevertheless be clearly identified and differentiated using remotely sensed maps of vegetation and disturbance.","2014","2020-02-27 19:10:09","2020-10-07 00:02:55","","207-217","","","150","","","","","","","","","","En","","","","","","","","<p>ForCaMF</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\R9DG5Q9A\Healy et al. - 2014 - A framework for simulating map error in ecosystem .pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Decisions on biomass utilization should be based on the most economical and mature route. This study analyzes mountain pine beetle (MPB) killed wood as the feedstock for production of bio-ethanol and bio-oil and compares it with the direct combustion route to produce electricity. The MPB infestation of British Columbia's (BC), a western province of Canada, forest has reached an epidemic proportion and is spread over an area of 10 million ha. According to the current estimates of BC's Ministry of Forests and Range, about 1 billion m(3) of trees would be killed by MPB by 2013. This infestation would result in large scale loss of jobs and the standing dead trees are a fire hazard and if left unharvested will decay and release carbon back to the atmosphere. The cost of bio-ethanot production from a 2100 dry tonne/day plant using the infested wood for two locations (one remote and other near the industry) in BC is in the range of C$0.37-C$0.40/1 (C$1.40-C$1.51/gallon). Similarly, cost of bio-oil production from a 220 dry tonne/day plant using the infested wood for same two locations in BC is in the range of C$0.27-C$0.29/1 (C$1.02-C$1.09/gallon). The cost of producing electricity using this bio-oil is above C$100/MWh which is higher than the current power price in BC. This cost is also higher than the cost of production of electricity by direct combustion of infested wood in a boiler (C$68-C$74/MWh). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Although their global area is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that of terrestrial forests, the contribution of vegetated coastal habitats per unit area to long-term C sequestration is much greater, in part because of their efficiency in trapping suspended matter and associated organic C during tidal inundation. Despite the value of mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes in sequestering C, and the other goods and services they provide, these systems are being lost at critical rates and action is urgently needed to prevent further degradation and loss. Recognition of the C sequestration value of vegetated coastal ecosystems provides a strong argument for their protection and restoration; however, it is necessary to improve scientific understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control C sequestration in these ecosystems. Here, we identify key areas of uncertainty and specific actions needed to address them.","2011","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-02-17 00:12:14","","552-560","","10","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\9FG4CC6R\McLeod et al. - 2011 - A Blueprint For Blue Carbon Toward an Improved Un.pdf","","Wetlands; Biomass; Journal Article; Sequestration; Aquatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we evaluated the variability in the sensitivity of permafrost and C in recent decades among land surface model simulations over the permafrost region between 1960 and 2009. The 15 model simulations all predict a loss of near-surface permafrost (within 3m) area over the region, but there are large differences in the magnitude of the simulated rates of loss among the models (0.2 to 58.8 × 103 km2 yr 1). Sensitivity simulations indicated that changes in air temperature largely explained changes in permafrost area, although interactions among changes in other environmental variables also played a role. All of the models indicate that both vegetation and soil C storage together have increased by 156 to 954 Tg C yr 1 between 1960 and 2009 over the permafrost region even though model analyses indicate that warming alone would decrease soil C storage. Increases in gross primary production (GPP) largely explain the simulated increases in vegetation and soil C. The sensitivity of GPP to increases in atmospheric CO2 was the dominant cause of increases in GPP across the models, but comparison of simulated GPP trends across the 1982–2009 period with that of a global GPP data set indicates that all of the models overestimate the trend in GPP. Disturbance also appears to be an important factor affecting C storage, as models that consider disturbance had lower increases in C storage than models that did not consider disturbance. To improve the modeling of C in the permafrost region, there is the need for the modeling community to standardize structural representation of permafrost and carbon dynamics among models that are used to evaluate the permafrost C feedback and for the modeling and observational communities to jointly develop data sets and methodologies to more effectively benchmark models","2016","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-12-03 19:25:22","","1015-1037","","7","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\FPB2KBWQ\McGuire et al. - 2016 - Variability in the Sensitivity Among Model Simulat.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Processes; Soil; Perfmafrost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O) may offset or even overturn the climate cooling effect induced by the CO2 sink. Using a coupled biogeochemical model, in this study, we have estimated the combined global warming potentials (GWP) of CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes in North American terrestrial ecosystems and quantified the relative contributions of environmental factors to the GWP changes during 1979 - 2010. The uncertainty range for contemporary global warming potential has been quantified by synthesizing the existing estimates from inventory, forward modeling, and inverse modeling approaches. Our “best estimate” of net GWP for CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes was -0.50±0.27 Pg CO2 eq/year (1 Pg=1015 g) in North American terrestrial ecosystems during 2001 - 2010. The emissions of CH4 and N2O from terrestrial ecosystems had offset about two thirds (73 %±14 %) of the land CO2 sink in the North American continent, showing large differences across the three countries, with offset ratios of 57%±8%inUS, 83%± 17 % in Canada and 329 %±119 % in Mexico. Climate change and elevated tropospheric ozone concentration have contributed the most to GWP increase, while elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration have contributed the most to GWP reduction. Extreme drought events over certain periods could result in a positive GWP. By integrating the existing estimates, we have found a wide range of uncertainty for the combined GWP. From both climate change science and policy perspectives, it is necessary to integrate ground and satellite observations with models for a more accurate accounting of these three greenhouse gases in North America.","2015","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-03-03 19:15:27","","413-426","","3-4","129","","","","","","","","","","","","","","26005232","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\45I4H8Z4\Tian et al. - 2015 - North American Terrestrial CO2 Uptake Largely Offs.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Offset","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first product is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree TBM and IM outputs to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability, the monthly/yearly Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP), Total Vegetation Carbon (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions (FE) outputs from the 22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree resolution gridded format to the inventory zones and then, further divided into Forest Lands, Crop Lands, and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based on the 1-km resolution GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003). The second product is the North American national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones which contain estimated land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands, crop lands, and other lands sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based data on productivity, ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock change, and additional information from national-level GHG inventories of the United States, Canada, and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada (2011). An additional summary file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006) is provided for both land sectors and reporting zones in North America and was created by combining the aggregated model output and the national GHG database and is provided.

Many process based models have been developed, but high uncertainties remain in estimating the amount of CH4 released from wetlands at the global scale. This study tries to improve estimates of CH4 emissions by upscaling a wetland CH4 emission model, PEATLANDVU, to the global scale with a spatial resolution of 0.5° for the period 2001 to 2006. This upscaling was based on the global circum arctic distribution of wetlands with hydrological conditions being specified by a global hydrological model,  PCRGLOBWB. In addition to the daily hydrological output from PCRGLOBWB, comprising water table depths and snow thickness, the parameterization included air temperature as obtained from the ECMWF Operational Archive. To establish the uncertainty in the representations of the circum arctic distribution of wetlands on the CH4 emission, several existing products were used to aggregate the emissions. Using the description of potential peatlands from the FAO Digital Soil Map of the World and the representation of floodplains by PCRGLOBWB, the average annual flux over the period 2001 to 2006 was estimated to be 78 Tg yr -1. In comparison, the six year average CH4 fluxes were 37.7, 89.4, 145.6, and 157.3 Tg yr -1 for different estimates of wetland extends based on the studies by Matthews and Fung, Prigent et al., Lehner and Döll, and Kaplan, respectively. This study shows the feasibility to estimate interannual variations in CH4 emissions by coupling hydrological and CH4 emission process models. It highlights the importance of an adequate understanding of hydrology in quantifying the total emissions from northern hemispheric wetlands and shows how knowledge of the sub grid variability in wetland extent helps to prescribe relevant hydrological conditions to the emission model as well as to identify the uncertainty associated with existing wetland distributions.","2010","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-03-03 23:58:47","","","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\NVRUZPTK\Petrescu et al. - 2010 - Modeling regional to global CH4 emissions of borea.pdf","","Wetlands; Modeling; Journal Article; Boreal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"M8YQM9HG","report","2012","","Baseline and Projected Future Carbon Storage and Greenhouse-gas Fluxes in Ecosystems of the Western United States","","","","","","This is the second in a series of reports produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to fulfill the requirements of section 712 of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 and to conduct a comprehensive national assessment of carbon (C) storage and flux (flow) and the fluxes of other greenhouse gases (GHGs, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O)). These carbon and GHG variables were examined in the Western United States for major terrestrial ecosystems (forests, grasslands/shrublands, agricultural lands, and wetlands) and aquatic ecosystems (rivers, streams, lakes, estuaries, and coastal waters) in two time periods: baseline (the first half of the 2000s) and future (projections from baseline to 2050). The major questions that this assessment attempted to answer included the following: (1) How much carbon was stored in ecosystems of the Western United States? (2) How much carbon could be stored in future years? (3) How were the carbon storage and fluxes in the Western United States influenced by both natural and anthropogenic processes such as land use, wildland fire, and climate change? (4) How might carbon storage, carbon flux, and the natural and anthropogenic processes that influence carbon cycling in western ecosystems vary both geographically and temporally? The assessment covered 2.66 million square kilometers (km2) in the Western United States, which is divided into in five level II ecoregions (as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)): Western Cordillera, Marine West Coast Forest, Cold Deserts, Warm Deserts, and Mediterranean California. The assessment was based on measured and  remotely sensed data collected by the USGS and many other agencies and organizations combined with statistical methods and simulation models. The major findings and discussion follow below. Baseline and Projected Future Land-Use and Land-Cover Change  In 2005, the total area of the Western United States (2.66 million km2) was distributed over these ecosystems: grasslands/shrublands (58.9 percent), forests (28.1 percent), agricultural lands (6.1 percent), water (1.5 percent), wetlands (0.38 percent), and other land types (5.2 percent). Between 1992 and 2005, changes in land use (such as croplands) and land cover (such as wetlands) in the Western United States affected 2.9 percent of that land area and were driven by demands for forest products, urban development, and agriculture. The change in land use and land cover (LULC) from 2006 to 2050 for all ecosystems in the Western United States was projected to be between 5.8 and 7.8 percent. The most active ecoregions of projected land use and cover (LULC) change were the Marine West Coast Forest, Western Cordillera, and Mediterranean California. The projected changes (to 2050) in both LULC and climate were used in this assessment to support the projection of future potential carbon storage and fluxes in relation to both ecological and economic processes. The resulting projections were highly variable across regions as were the assumptions that were made. Between the regions and the assumptions, the overall rates of projected LULC change varied from 1.3 percent to 45 percent. The models of projected climate change (using general circulation model data) indicated (1) a projected general increase in both the mean temperature and in extreme temperatures throughout the Western United States, and (2) a projected high variability in precipitation change that depended on the ecoregion, seasonality, downscaling, and interannual variability. Baseline Carbon Storage and Flux The estimated average total carbon storage in the ecosystems of the Western United States in 2005 was approximately 13,920 (12,418-15,460) teragrams of carbon (TgC), which was distributed in forests (69 percent), grasslands/shrublands (25 percent), agricultural lands (4.3 percent), wetlands (0.46 percent), and other lands (0.63 percent). Geographically, the estimated total and per-unit-ofarea carbon stocks ranged from 700.2 TgC (the Cold Deserts) to 8,162.8 TgC (the Western Cordillera) and from 1.5 kilograms of carbon per square meter (kgC/m2) (the Cold Deserts) to 16.1 kgC/m2 (the Marine West Coast Forest), respectively. On average, the forests in the Western United States maintained the largest stock of carbon per unit of area among all of the ecosystems at 13.0 kgC/m2, followed by wetlands (6.3 kgC/m2), agricultural lands (3.7 kgC/m2), grasslands/shrublands (2.2 kgC/m2), and other land types (0.5 kgC/m2). Overall, live biomass and soil organic carbon (assessed in the top 20-cm-thick layer) accounted for 38 and 39 percent of the total carbon stock, respectively, and woody debris and other surface carbon pools represented the remaining 23 percent.  The net carbon flux was calculated as the change of carbon stock between two points in time. A negative number indicates carbon uptake, carbon sequestration, or a carbon sink; a positive number indicates a carbon emission or a carbon source. From 2001 to 2005, an average annual net flux of -86.6 (-162.9 to -13.6) TgC/yr was estimated for all of the terrestrial ecosystems in the Western United States. In lakes and reservoirs throughout the Western United States, an additional -2.4 (-3.7 to -1.2) TgC/yr was estimated to be buried and sequestered in sediments. The flux  in the Pacific coastal waters was approximately -2.0 TgC/yr. Thus, the combined estimates resulted in a total annual carbon sequestration rate of -91 TgC/yr across all of the major ecosystems in the Western United States; this rate is equivalent to 4.9 percent of the nation’s net fossil-fuel emissions in 2010 as reported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 2010). Most of the net carbon flux was in forests (62.2 percent, -72.1 grams of carbon per square meter per year, or gC/m2/yr), followed by grasslands/shrublands (29.6 percent, -16.4 gC/m2/yr), agricultural lands (7.1 percent, -38.3 gC/m2/yr), and wetlands (0.96 percent, -82.1 gC/m2/yr). For comparison, a recent study found that the net carbon fluxes in forests were approximately -93 gC/m2/yr for the United States as a whole and -103 gC/m2/yr for the world’s temperate forests (Pan, Birdsey, and others, 2011). Of the total carbon sink, live biomass accounted for 32 percent, soil organic matter accounted for 45 percent, and dead biomass accounted for 23 percent.  Projected Future Potential Carbon Storage and Flux In order to project the future potential carbon storage amounts and flux rates, combinations of LULC scenarios and climate projections, developed on an annual basis between 2006 and 2050, were used along with multiple biogeochemical models for the assessment. The results of these combinations led to a range of estimates for both carbon storage and flux under a range of projected future conditions. The results of projected future potential carbon stock and flux were highly variable among multiple model runs, ecoregions, and ecosystems The total amount of carbon that potentially could be stored in the ecosystems of the Western United States in 2050 was projected to range from 13,743 to 19,407 TgC, which is an increase of 1,325 to 3,947 TgC (or 10.7 to 25.5 percent) from baseline conditions of 2005. Among the five ecoregions, the Western Cordillera potentially could store the most carbon, accounting for 60 percent of the projected future total carbon storage for the Western United States, followed by the Cold Deserts (18 percent of the total), Marine West Coast Forest (10 percent), Mediterranean California (8 percent), and Warm Deserts (4 percent). Among the different ecosystems, the forests potentially could store the most carbon, accounting for 70 percent of the total potential carbon storage in the Western United States, followed by grasslands/shrublands (23 percent of the total), and agricultural lands (6 percent). The potential mean annual net carbon flux between 2006 and 2050 was projected to range from -113.9 TgC/yr to 2.9 TgC/yr. When compared to the baseline net carbon flux estimates (-162.9 to -13.6 TgC/yr), the projected future carbonsequestration rates in the Western United States represented a potential decline by 16.5 to 49 TgC/yr. The projected decline came largely from ecosystems of grasslands/shrublands and forests and was distributed mostly in the Western Cordillera ecoregion. Baseline and Projected Future Potential Wildland Fire Combustion Emissions Wildland fire is a major ecosystem disturbance in the Western United States that is influenced by changes in both climate and land use and leads to a considerable interannual and regional variability in GHG emissions.   Between 2001 and 2008 in the Western United States, the burned areas and their GHG emissions from combustion ranged from 3,345 to 25,206 square kilometers per year (km2/yr), and from 6.8 to 75.3 teragrams of carbon dioxide equivalents per year (TgCO2-eq/yr) (1.9 to 20.6 TgC/yr), respectively, mostly in the Western Cordillera and Cold Deserts ecoregions. The annual average GHG emission from the fires was 36.7 TgCO2-eq/yr (10.0 TgC/yr), which was equivalent to 11.6 percent of the estimated average rate of carbon sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems in the Western United States.   Under future projections of climate change, the area burned by wildland fires was projected to increase by 31 to 66 percent and the GHG combustion emissions from wildland fires were projected to increase by 28 to 56 percent, relative to baseline conditions. These projections, combined with the projected decline in future terrestrial carbon sequestration, could lead to wildland fire combustion emissions equivalent to 27 to 43 percent of carbon sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems in the Western United States. Under extreme climate conditions, wildland fire emissions were projected to increase 73 to 150 percent relative to baseline conditions. Carbon stored in the arid and semiarid parts of the Western United States is especially vulnerable to wildland-fire emissions. Carbon Cycling in Aquatic Ecosystems of the Western United States Carbon cycling in and out of the aquatic ecosystems was studied separately from the terrestrial ecosystems in the Western United States. Carbon fluxes and rates of burial within sediments in inland water bodies and coastal waters were estimated using separate methods. The derived results are as follows:  Using data collected between the 1970s and the present, rivers and streams throughout the Western United States were estimated to transport between 5.5 and 8.9 (average 7.2) TgC/yr (or an average of 3.4 gC/m2/yr in yield per unit of area) of dissolved inorganic and total organic carbon annually from upstream sources to estuaries and the coastal oceans, where most was returned to the atmosphere. The emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from inland waters of the Western United States ranged from 16.8 to 48.7 (average 28.2) TgC/yr (or an average of 14.8 gC/m2/yr in yield per unit of area); 93 percent of the total emissions were from rivers and streams and 7 percent were from lakes and reservoirs.  The rate of carbon burial (sequestration) in the sediments in the lakes and reservoirs was estimated to range from -1.2 to -3.7 (average -2.4) TgC/yr (or an average of -1.2 gC/m2/yr in yield per unit of area), whereas in coastal waters the average burial rate was approximately 2.0 TgC/yr. The estimates of carbon fluxes in aquatic ecosystems were highly variable because of differences in precipitation, topography, lithology, and other controlling processes. Baseline and Projected Future Greenhouse-Gas Fluxes In addition to the baseline net carbon flux estimates (-162.9 to -13.6 TgC/yr, or -597.7 to -50.0 TgCO2-eq/yr), the baseline methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux rates were also estimated and were relatively low and highly variable among ecosystems and ecoregions. Overall, the estimated flux rate of methane during the baseline years ranged from -3.1 to  -2.9 TgCO2-eq/yr. The estimated flux rate of nitrous oxide remained stable over the baseline years and averaged 1.7 TgCO2 -eq/yr. The balance between the three GHGs was projected to continue to 2050, with a large but weakened sink for CO2 and a weak sink or source for CH4 and N2O, depending on the variability of the projected results.","2012","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-12-07 19:12:14","","192","","","","","","","","","","","U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1797","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\RDZDAM58\2012 - Baseline and Projected Future Carbon Storage and G.pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Pools; Flux; Soil; Aquatic; WD; Reports (non-GTR)","","","Zhu, Z.; Reed, B.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The United States Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program has developed a large database of stock changes derived from consecutive estimates of growing stock volume in the U.S. These data reveal a large and relatively stable increase in forest carbon stocks over the last two decades or more. The mechanisms underlying this national increase in forest stocks may include recovery of forests from past disturbances, net increases in forest area, and growth enhancement driven by climate or fertilization by CO2 and Nitrogen. Here we estimate the forest recovery component of the observed stock changes using FIA data on the age structure of U.S. forests and carbon stocks as a function of age. The latter are used to parameterize forest disturbance and recovery processes in a carbon cycle model. We then apply resulting disturbance/recovery dynamics to landscapes and regions based on the forest age distributions. The analysis centers on 28 representative climate settings spread about forested regions of the conterminous U.S. We estimate carbon fluxes for each region and propagate uncertainties in calibration data through to the predicted fluxes. The largest recovery-driven carbon sinks are found in the South Central, Pacific Northwest, and Pacific Southwest regions, with spatially averaged net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of about 100 g C m 2 a 1 driven by forest age structure. Carbon sinks from recovery in the Northeast and Northern Lakes States remain moderate to large owing to the legacy of historical clearing and relatively low modern disturbance rates from harvest and fire. At the continental scale, we find a conterminous U.S. forest NEP of only 0.16 Pg C a 1 from age structure in 2005, or only 0.047 Pg C a 1 of forest stock change after accounting for fire emissions and harvest transfers. Recent estimates of NEP derived from inventory stock change, harvest, and fire data show twice the NEP sink we derive from forest age distributions. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancies including modeling errors and the possibility of climate and/or fertilization (CO2 or N) growth enhancements.","2012","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-12-07 18:36:48","","","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\2I8LFV76\Williams et al. - 2012 - Carbon Consequences of Forest Disturbance and Reco.pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; Flux; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Use of a systems perspective highlights trade-offs between activities aimed at increasing carbon storage in the ecosystem, increasing carbon storage in harvested wood products (HWPs), or increasing the substitution benefits of using wood in place of fossil fuels or more emissions-intensive products. A systems perspective also suggests that erroneous conclusions about mitigation potential could result if analyses assume thatHWPcarbon is emitted at harvest, or bioenergy is carbon neutral. The greatest short-run boreal mitigation benefit generally would be achieved by avoiding greenhouse gas emissions; but over the longer run, there could be significant potential in activities that increase carbon removals. Mitigation activities could maximize landscape carbon uptake or maximize landscape carbon density, but not both simultaneously. The difference between the two is the rate at which HWPs are produced to meet society's demands, and mitigation activities could seek to delay or reduce HWP emissions and increase substitution benefits. Use of forest biomass for bioenergy could also contribute though the point in time at which this produces a net mitigation benefit relative to a fossil fuel alternative will be situation-specific. Key knowledge gaps exist in understanding boreal mitigation strategies that are robust to climate change and how mitigation could be integrated with adaptation to climate change.","2013","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-01-20 22:27:29","","293-321","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\Y4CLZJMM\Lemprière et al. - 2013 - Canadian Boreal Forests and Climate Change Mitigat.pdf","","Journal Article; Sequestration; Boreal; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Detailed monitoring of C exchange between forests and the atmosphere and improved understanding of the processes that affect the net ecosystem exchange of C are needed to improve our understanding of the terrestrial C budget. We estimated the C budget of Canada's 2.3 × 106km2 managed forests from 1990 to 2008 using an empirical modelling approach driven by detailed forestry datasets. We estimated that average net primary production (NPP) during this period was 809 ± 5TgCyr -1 (352gCm -2yr -1) and net ecosystem production (NEP) was 71 ± 9TgCyr-1 (31gCm -2yr -1). Harvesting transferred 45 ± 4TgCyr -1 out of the ecosystem and 45 ± 4TgCyr -1 within the ecosystem (from living biomass to dead organic matter pools). Fires released 23 ± 16TgCyr -1 directly to the atmosphere, and fires, insects and other natural disturbances transferred 52 ± 41TgCyr -1 from biomass to dead organic matter pools, from where C will gradually be released through decomposition. Net biome production (NBP) was only 2 ± 20TgCyr -1 (1gCm -2yr -1); the low C sequestration ratio (NBP/NPP=0.3%) is attributed to the high average age of Canada's managed forests and the impact of natural disturbances. Although net losses of ecosystem C occurred during several years due to large fires and widespread bark beetle outbreak, Canada's managed forests were a sink for atmospheric CO2 in all years, with an uptake of 50 ± 18TgCyr -1 [net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2= -22gCm -2yr -1].","2011","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-03-04 18:33:50","","2227-2244","","6","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\853YRY4B\Stinson et al. - 2011 - An inventory based analysis of Canada's managed fo.pdf","","Carbon Cycle; Management; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These emissions as radiatively active greenhouse gases in the form of both CO2 and CH4 could amplify global warming. Given the potential sensitivity of these ecosystems to climate change and the expectation that the Arctic will experience appreciable warming over the next century, it is important to assess whether responses of C exchange in tundra regions are likely to enhance or mitigate warming. In this study we compared analyses of C exchange of Arctic tundra between 1990 and 2006 among observations, regional and global applications of process-based terrestrial biosphere models, and atmospheric inversion models. Syntheses of flux observations and inversion models indicate that the annual exchange of CO2 between Arctic tundra and the atmosphere has large uncertainties that cannot be distinguished from neutral balance. The mean estimate from an ensemble of process-based model simulations suggests that Arctic tundra has acted as a sink for atmospheric CO2 in recent decades, but based on the uncertainty estimates it cannot be determined with confidence whether these ecosystems represent a weak or a strong sink. Tundra was 0.6  C warmer in the 2000s compared to the 1990s. The central estimates of the observations, process-based models, and inversion models each identify stronger sinks in the 2000s compared with the 1990s. Some of the process models indicate that this occurred because net primary production increased more in response to warming than heterotrophic respiration. Similarly, the observations and the applications of regional process-based models suggest that CH4 emissions from Arctic tundra have increased from the 1990s to 2000s because of the sensitivity of CH4 emissions to warmer temperatures. Based on our analyses of the estimates from observations, process-based models, and inversion models, we estimate that Arctic tundra was a sink for atmospheric CO2 of 110 TgC yr-1 (uncertainty between a sink of 291 TgC yr-1 and a source of 80 Tg Cyr-1) and a source of CH4 to the atmosphere of 19 TgC yr-1 (uncertainty between sources of 8 and 29 Tg Cyr-1). The suite of analyses conducted in this study indicate that it is important to reduce uncertainties in the observations, process-based models, and inversions in order to better understand the degree to which Arctic tundra is influencing atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations. The reduction of uncertainties can be accomplished through (1) the strategic placement of more CO2 and CH4 monitoring stations to reduce uncertainties in inversions, (2) improved observation networks of ground-based measurements of CO2 and CH4 exchange to understand exchange in response to disturbance and across gradients of climatic and hydrological variability, and (3) the effective transfer of information from enhanced observation networks into process-based models to improve the simulation of CO2 and CH4 exchange from Arctic tundra to the atmosphere.","2012","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-12-07 22:34:23","","3185-3204","","8","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\93K38UF9\McGuire et al. - 2012 - An assessment of the carbon balance of Arctic tund.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"E62XJCT8","report","2016","","Baseline and projected future carbon storage and greenhouse-gas fluxes in ecosystems of Alaska","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/pp1826","Alaska is approximately one-fifth the area of the conterminous United States and spans a broad range in climate from the maritime coastal regions of south-central and southeast Alaska to the boreal forest region in interior Alaska to arctic and maritime tundra regions of northern and western Alaska. The cold temperatures of Alaska have led to the storage of vast quantities of soil and vegetation carbon. Although forest ecosystems of southeast Alaska have been regularly included in national resource or greenhouse-gas inventory programs, other regions of Alaska have not been included in national-level resource or greenhouse-gas inventory programs because of the large size of Alaska, the lack of extensive transportation infrastructure, and the low density of field data to support such programs. Yet, high-latitude ecosystems are potentially more vulnerable to climate change than ecosystems in the temperate zone during the remainder of the 21st century because temperature is projected to increase more in boreal and arctic regions. In particular, these increases in temperature may expose the substantial stores of carbon in the region to loss from more wildfire and permafrost thaw, which could turn the ecosystems of Alaska into a net carbon source. Therefore, the assessment of Alaska ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes as well as methane fluxes, as reported here, was conducted to better understand the baseline and projected carbon distributions and potential responses to a rapidly changing environment. The results of this assessment will inform national climate and carbon management policies.   Major components of the assessment included carbon and methane fluxes in upland and lowland (wetland) ecosystems, carbon fluxes of inland aquatic ecosystems, synthesis of soil carbon stocks and permafrost distribution, effects of forest management, and effects of climate change and associated shifts in vegetation and wildfire regime over space and time. Methods varied depending on the components, as described in respective chapters of this report. For uplands and wetlands, the boundaries of four Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) in Alaska were used to stratify and report the assessment. For inland aquatic ecosystems, the boundaries of six hydrologic regions were used for stratification and reporting. Major findings from the assessment are: • Estimates of total soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in boreal and arctic regions in Alaska, derived from both field observations and model simulations, ranged from 31 to 72 petagrams of carbon (PgC) from 1950 through 2009. In ecosystems with permafrost, the mean activelayer thickness (ALT; the maximum annual thaw depth) ranged between 76 and 84 centimeters (cm) from surface-derived field data; model simulations indicated that mean ALT was 86 cm. • A conceptual model of soil susceptibility to climate change indicated that the Arctic LCC and Western Alaska LCC lowland shrub tundra ecotypes are highly susceptible to climate change because of large frozen and unfrozen SOC stocks potentially available for loss by decomposition.  • Although there is a high variability in fire regime across interior Alaska, fire frequency, severity, and area burned have increased in recent years, and the trend was projected to continue for the rest of the century across most of the regions and most of the climate scenarios, with the boreal region projected to see the highest increase in fire activities. Correspondingly, in the boreal region late successional vegetation, such as spruce forest, was projected to decline, whereas early- to mid-successional vegetation, such as deciduous forest, was projected to increase. In tundra regions, shrub tundra was generally projected to increase and graminoid tundra to decrease. • During the historical period of this assessment (1950–2009), upland ecosystems in Alaska were, on average, an overall carbon sink across the State of 5.0 teragrams of carbon per year (TgC/yr). However, the boreal region of the State has been a carbon source, losing 5.1 TgC/yr as the result of increased fire activity in recent decades. The overall carbon sink was projected to increase to 14.7 to 34.6 TgC/yr during the projection period (2010–2099). • Perhumid coastal rainforest watersheds in southeast Alaska were net carbon sinks of an average 142 grams of carbon per square meter per year (gC/m2/yr) from 2006 through 2009. The non-fire-prone, cool, forested region is expected to remain a stable carbon sink, and potentially increase this sink strength in the future. • During the historical period (1950–2009), wetland ecosystems in Alaska were, on average, an overall carbon source at 1.3 TgC/yr across the State. Net biogenic methane emissions increased from 27.93 teragrams of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (TgCO2-eq/yr) in the first decade (1950–1959) to 30.93 TgCO2-eq/yr in the last decade (2000–2009). The combined global warming potential (GWP) of both carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4 ) was 33 TgCO2-eq/yr over the historical period. Wetland ecosystems in Alaska were projected to be a net carbon sink ranging from 3.0 to 6.8 TgC/yr and an increased methane source ranging from 37 to 90 TgCO2-eq/yr by 2099, yielding a GWP of 17 to 64 TgCO2-eq/yr. • Temperate forests in south-central and southeast coastal Alaska store 1,018 teragrams of carbon (TgC) in live and dead tree biomass. If managed with the current management plan (with forest harvesting) and assuming no climate change, the forest carbon could increase by 1 percent by the end of the century. Forest carbon could increase by 8 percent and 27 percent under the scenarios of climate change with and without management, respectively. • The total net carbon flux (coastal export plus CO2 emissions from rivers and lakes minus burial in lake sediments) from inland waters of Alaska was approximately 41.2 TgC/yr (ranging from 30 to 60 TgC/yr in terms of 5th and 95th percentiles). Total carbon yield based on total land surface area was 27 gC/m2/yr (uncertainty of 20 to 40 gC/m2/yr). • Putting it all together, we estimate that between 1950 and 2009 the upland and wetland ecosystems of the State sequestered an average of 3.7 TgC/yr, which is almost 2 percent of the net primary productivity (NPP) of the upland and wetland ecosystems. We estimate that inland aquatic ecosystems of Alaska lost 41.2 TgC/yr, or about 17 percent of upland and wetland NPP. We estimate that the greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing potential of upland and wetland ecosystems of Alaska was 17.3 TgCO2-eq/yr during the historical period. • Carbon sequestration of upland and wetland  ecosystems of Alaska in the projection period (2010–2099) would increase substantially to 18.2 to 34.4 TgC/yr, primarily because of an  increase in NPP of 12 to 30 percent associated  with responses to rising atmospheric CO2, increased nitrogen cycling, and longer growing seasons. Although carbon emissions to the atmosphere from wildfire were projected to increase substantially  for all of the projected climates, the increases in NPP would more than compensate for those losses. Our analysis indicates that upland and wetland ecosystems would be sinks for GHGs for all simulations during the projection period.","2016","2020-04-21 23:24:11","2021-12-07 17:39:39","","196","","","","","","","","","","","U.S. Geological Survey","","","","U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper","","","","","DOI: 10.3133/pp1826","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8ZRWGFEK\2016 - Baseline and projected future carbon storage and g.pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Pools; Alaska; Flux; Soil; Aquatic; Reports (non-GTR)","","","Zhu, Z.; McGuire, A.D.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1826","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By altering rates of input or release of C from soils, forest management activities can influence soil C stocks in forests. In this review, we synthesize current evidence regarding the influences of 13 common forest management practices on forest soil C stocks. Afforestation of former croplands generally increases soil C stocks, whereas on former grasslands and peatlands, soil C stocks are unchanged or even reduced following afforestation. The conversion of primary forests to secondary forests generally reduces soil C stocks, particularly if the land is converted to an agricultural land-use prior to reforestation. Harvesting, particularly clear-cut harvesting, generally results in a reduction in soil C stocks, particularly in the forest floor and upper mineral soil. Removal of residues by harvesting whole-trees and stumps negatively affects soil C stocks. Soil disturbance from site preparation decreases soil C stocks, particularly in the organic top soil, however improved growth of tree seedlings may outweigh soil C losses over a rotation. Nitrogen (N) addition has an overall positive effect on soil C stocks across a wide range of forest ecosystems. Likewise, higher stocks and faster accumulation of soil C occur under tree species with N-fixing associates. Stocks and accumulation rates of soil C also differ under different tree species, with coniferous species accumulating more C in the forest floor and broadleaved species tending to store more C in the mineral soil. There is some evidence that increased tree species diversity could positively affect soil C stocks in temperate and subtropical forests, but tree species identity, particularly N-fixing species, seems to have a stronger impact on soil C stocks than tree species diversity. Management of stand density and thinning have small effects on forest soil C stocks. In forests with high populations of ungulate herbivores, reduction in herbivory levels can increase soil C stocks. Removal of plant biomass for fodder and fuel is related to a reduction in the soil C stocks. Fire management practices such as prescribed burning reduce soil C stocks, but less so than wildfires which are more intense. For each practice, we identify existing gaps in knowledge and suggest research to address the gaps.","2020-06","2020-04-20 21:01:44","2020-10-07 22:25:28","2020-04-20 21:01:44","118127","","","466","","","Tamm Review","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\F4NM7Z9W\Mayer et al. - 2020 - Tamm Review Influence of forest management activi.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, an adequate representation of ecosystem response to water stress in land models is critical for predicting carbon dynamics. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4.5 against observations at an old-growth coniferous forest site in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States (Wind River AmeriFlux site), characterized by a Mediterranean climate that subjects trees to water stress each summer. CLM was driven by site-observed meteorology and calibrated primarily using parameter values observed at the site or at similar stands in the region. Key model adjustments included parameters controlling specific leaf area and stomatal conductance. Default values of these parameters led to significant underestimation of gross primary production, overestimation of evapotranspiration, and consequently overestimation of photosynthetic 13C discrimination, reflected in reduced 13C : 12C ratios of carbon fluxes and pools. Adjustments in soil hydraulic parameters within CLM were also critical, preventing significant underestimation of soil water content and unrealistic soil moisture stress during summer. After calibration, CLM was able to simulate energy and carbon fluxes, leaf area index, biomass stocks, and carbon isotope ratios of carbon fluxes and pools in reasonable agreement with site observations. Overall, the calibrated CLM was able to simulate the observed response of canopy conductance to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and soil water content, reasonably capturing the impact of water stress on ecosystem functioning. Both simulations and observations indicate that stomatal response from water stress at Wind River was primarily driven by VPD and not soil moisture. The calibration of the Ball–Berry stomatal conductance slope (mbb) at Wind River aligned with findings from recent CLM experiments at sites characterized by the same plant functional type (needleleaf evergreen temperate forest), despite significant differences in stand composition and age and climatology, suggesting that CLM could benefit from a revised mbb value of 6, rather than the default value of 9, for this plant functional type. Conversely, Wind River required a unique calibration of the hydrology submodel to simulate soil moisture, suggesting that the default hydrology has a more limited applicability. This study demonstrates that carbon isotope data can be used to constrain stomatal conductance and intrinsic water use efficiency in CLM, as an alternative to eddy covariance flux measurements. It also demonstrates that carbon isotopes can expose structural weaknesses in the model and provide a key constraint that may guide future model development.","2017-09-28","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-05 23:48:18","2019-05-13 23:05:30","4315-4340","","18","14","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QQIVXLXY\Duarte et al. - 2017 - Evaluating the Community Land Model (CLM4.5) at a .pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Features include feedback through canopy conductance between photosynthesis and transpiration and interactive coupling between these ‘fast’ processes and other ecosystem processes including resource competition, tissue turnover, population dynamics, soil organic matter and litter dynamics and fire disturbance. Ten plants functional types (PFTs) are differentiated by physiological, morphological, phenological, bioclimatic and fire-response attributes. Resource competition and differential responses to fire between PFTs influence their relative fractional cover from year to year. Photosynthesis, evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics are modelled on a daily time step, while vegetation structure and PFT population densities are updated annually. Simulations have been made over the industrial period both for specific sites where field measurements were available for model evaluation, and globally on a 0.5°×0.5° grid. Modelled vegetation patterns are consistent with observations, including remotely sensed vegetation structure and phenology. Seasonal cycles of net ecosystem exchange and soil moisture compare well with local measurements. Global carbon exchange fields used as input to an atmospheric tracer transport model (TM2) provided a good fit to observed seasonal cycles of CO2 concentration at all latitudes. Simulated inter-annual variability of the global terrestrial carbon balance is in phase with and comparable in amplitude to observed variability in the growth rate of atmospheric CO2.

Advances in dynamic ecosystem modelling have made a number of different approaches to vegetation dynamics possible. Here we compare two models representing contrasting degrees of abstraction of the processes governing dynamics in real vegetation. 2. Model (a) (GUESS) simulates explicitly growth and competition among individual plants. Differences in crown structure (height, depth, area and LAI) influence relative light uptake by neighbours. Assimilated carbon is allocated individually by each plant to its leaf, fine root and sapwood tissues. Carbon allocation and turnover of sapwood to heartwood in turn govern height and diameter growth. 3. Model (b) (LPJ) incorporates a ‘dynamic global vegetation model’ (DGVM) architecture, simulating growth of populations of plant functional types (PFTs) over a grid cell, integrating individual level processes over the proportional area (foliar projective cover, FPC) occupied by each PFT. Individual plants are not simulated, but are replaced by explicit parameterizations of their growth and interactions. 4. The models are identical in their representation of core physiological and biogeochemical processes. Both also use the same set of PFTs, corresponding to the major woody plant groups in Europe, plus a grass type. 5. When applied at a range of locations, broadly spanning climatic variation within Europe, both models successfully predicted PFT composition and succession within modern natural vegetation. However, the individual-based model performed better in areas where deciduous and evergreen types coincide, and in areas subject to pronounced seasonal water deficits, which would tend to favour grasses over drought-intolerant trees. 6. Differences in model performance could be traced to their treatment of individual-level processes, in particular light competition and stress-induced mortality. 7. Our results suggest that an explicit individual-based approach to vegetation dynamics may be an advantage in modelling of ecosystem structure and function at the resolution required for regional - to continental - scale studies.","2001","2020-04-16 20:37:08","2021-03-04 18:42:47","","621-637","","6","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>LPJ</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\JZT6SRUA\Smith et al. - 2001 - Representation of vegetation dynamics in the model.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CARAIB, a mechanistic model of carbon assimilation in the biosphere estimates the net primary productivity (NPP) of the continental vegetation on a grid of 1 x 1 degrees in latitude and longitude. The model considers the annual and diurnal cycles. It is based on the coupling of the three following submodels; a leaf assimilation model including estimates of stomatal conductance and leaf respiration, a canopy model describing principally the radiative transfer through the foliage, and a wood respiration model. Present-day climate and vegetation characteristics allow the discrimination between ecotypes. In particular, specific information on vegetation distribution and properties is successfully used at four levels; the leaf physiological level, the plant level, the ecosystem level, and the global level. The productivity determined by the C ARAIB model is compared with local measurements and empirical estimates showing a good agreement with a global value of 65 Gt C yr -1. The sensitivity of the model to the diurnal cycle and to the abundance of C4 species is also tested. The productivity slightly decreases (10%) when the diurnal cycle of the temperature is neglected. By contrast, neglecting the diurnal cycle of solar irradiance produces unrealistically high values of NPP. Even if the importance of this increase would presumably be reduced by the coupling of CARAIB with a nutrient cycle model, this test emphasizes the key role of the diurnal cycle in a mechanistic model of the NPP. Uncertainties on the abundance and spatial distribution of Ca plants may cause errors in the NPP estimates, however, as demonstrated by two sensitivity tests, these errors are certainly lower than 10% at the global scale as shown by two tests.","1994","2020-03-30 21:37:05","2021-03-03 18:40:01","","255-270","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>CARAIB</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\47STZYZZ\Warnant et al. - 1994 - CARAIB A global model of terrestrial biological p.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this fourth version of CARAIB, we differentiate ground-level grasses from tree canopies, which allows us to determine the light available to grasses as a direct function of the leaf area index (LAI) of the forest canopy. Both of these storeys are potentially composed of several plant functional types (PFT). The cover fraction of each PFT within each storey is estimated according to its respective net primary productivity (NPP). A biome is assigned to each grid cell on the basis of three physiological criteria: (1) the cover fraction, (2) the NPP, and (3) the LAI; and two climatic constraints: (1) the growing degree-days (GDD) and (2) the lowest temperature reached during the cold season (Tmin), which are well-known indices of vegetation expansion boundaries. Total biospheric carbon stocks (vegetation + soil) are reconstructed by forcing the model with eight climatic scenarios of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21 ka BP), which were obtained from the Paleo-Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) from four general circulation models (MRI2, UGAMP, LMD4, and GEN2) using prescribed and computed sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The model was also forced with a current climate together with a preindustrial atmospheric CO2 level of 280 ppm as reference simulation. To validate the model, current biome distribution is reconstructed and compared, for the modern climate, with two distributions of potential vegetation and, for the LGM, with pollen data. The model simulations are in good agreement with broad-scale patterns of vegetation distribution. The results indicate an increase in the total biospheric carbon stock of 827.8 – 1106.1 Gt C since the LGM. Sensitivity analyses were performed to discriminate the relative effects of the atmospheric CO2 level (‘‘fertilization effect’’), the climate (present or LGM), and the sea level. Our results suggest that the CO2 fertilization effect is mostly responsible for the total increase in vegetation and soil carbon stocks. The four GCMs diverged in their predicted responses of continental climate to calculated SSTs. Only one of them, i.e., MRI2, predicted a marked decline of the continental temperatures in response to lower calculated SSTs. For this GCM, the effect of reduced SSTs on continental biospheric carbon stocks was a decrease of 544.1 Gt for the soil carbon stock and of 283.7 for the vegetation carbon stock, which means a decrease in the total biopsheric carbon stock of 827.8 Gt.","2001","2020-03-30 19:58:51","2020-10-07 23:45:17","","117-138","","","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>CARAIB</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\YETGB48L\Otto et al. - 2001 - Biospheric carbon stocks reconstructed at the Last.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the cause of the warming is probably not only attributable to CO2, but also to changes in orography and configuration of ocean gateways, this time interval represents an ideal case study to test the ability of climate models to simulate warm climates comparable to those that the Earth may experience in the near future. However, even with higher than present-day CO2 concentrations, the MMCO warming inferred from terrestrial proxy data has been difficult to reproduce in climate models. Since fossil flora do not provide direct information on climate, but on flora and vegetation, climate model results are generally compared to climate reconstructions obtained from the fossil flora. In this study, we apply an alternative method by simulating palaeovegetation from the outputs of the climate model, using a dynamic vegetation model. Model vegetation reconstruction can then be compared to the vegetation cover indicated by the fossil flora record at the various localities, provided that a common classification of plant functional types (PFTs) is used for the data and the model. Here, we reconstruct the vegetation of the middle Miocene with the global dynamic vegetation model CARAIB, using the climatologies derived from five atmospheric general circulation models. The reliability of the simulations is examined on a presence/absence basis of PFTs by comparison of vegetation reconstructions to palaeoflora data recorded in the Northern Hemisphere and the Tropics. This comparison provides an overall agreement around 60% between model and data, when all sites and tree types are considered. Three model simulations out of five show to be better at predicting the absence than the presence. The presence of warm-temperate mixed forests in the middle latitudes, dominated by broadleaved deciduous warm temperate and subtropical trees is generally well reproduced in CARAIB simulations. However, poor agreement is obtained for the presence of tropical PFTs out of the Tropics and for warm PFTs at latitudes northward of 50°N, where climate models remain too cold to produce assemblages of trees consistent with the data. Nevertheless, the model–data comparison performed here highlights several mismatches that could result not only from missing feedbacks in the climate simulations, but also from the data. The results of the likelihood analysis on presence/absence of PFTs illustrate the uncertainties in the PFT classification of the Neogene floral records. The coexistence of some PFTs in the palaeovegetation data is impossible to reproduce in the vegetation model simulations because of the climatic definition of the modern PFTs. This result indicates either a bias in the identification of modern analogues for fossil plant taxa, or a possible evolution of environmental requirements of certain plants.","2016","2020-03-30 18:15:12","2020-10-07 00:23:54","","95-119","","","467","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>CARAIB</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QTXMIPCJ\Henrot et al. - 2016 - Middle Miocene climate and vegetation models and t.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CLM3.0 has known biases in the surface energy partitioning as a result of deficiencies in its hydrological and biophysical parameterizations. Such models, however, need to be robust for multidecadal global climate simulations. FLUXNET now provides an extensive data source of carbon, water and energy exchanges for investigating land processes, and it encompasses a global range of ecosystem-climate interactions. Data from 15 FLUXNET sites are used to identify and improve model deficiencies. Including a prognostic aquifer, a bare soil evaporation resistance formulation and numerous other changes in the model result in a significantly improved soil hydrology and energy partitioning. Terrestrial water storage increased by up to 300 mm in warm climates and decreased in cold climates. Nitrogen control of photosynthesis is revealed as another missing process in the model. These improvements increase the correlation coefficient of hourly and monthly latent heat fluxes from a range of 0.5-0.6 to the range of 0.7-0.9. RMSE of the simulated sensible heat fluxes decrease by 20-50%. Primary production is overestimated during the wet season in mediterranean and tropical ecosystems. This might be related to missing carbon - nitrogen dynamics as well as to site-specific parameters. The new model (CLM3.5) with an improved terrestrial water cycle should lead to more realistic land-atmosphere exchanges in coupled simulations. FLUXNET is found to be a valuable tool to develop and validate land surface models prior to their application in computationally expensive global simulations.","2008","2020-03-30 17:42:31","2021-03-04 18:36:34","","19","","G01025","113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>CLM</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\TQCNGWHE\Stocki et al. - 2008 - Use of FLUXNET in the Community Land Model develop.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One, the biogeochemical cycles (BIOME-BGC) model, simulates the storage and fluxes of water, carbon and nitrogen within the vegetation, litter and soil components of a terrestrial ecosystem. The model permits sophisticated simulations of natural ecosystems such as forest, grassland and shrub-land. However, it has rarely been applied to agricultural ecosystems. This study was conducted for exploring the ability of the BIOME-BGC for crops in China. For this propose, we set up an eddy-covariance tower in the North China Plain in 2002 and have obtained both flux data and related data of meteorological, vegetation and soil properties. By using these observation data, we modified eco-physiological parameters in the model. Correspondence between the simulated results with observations suggested that the modified model can be used to predict crop growth as well as water (H2O) and carbon (CO2) fluxes under the consideration of the effects of anthropogenic forcing. To estimate the effects of anthropogenic forcing, we executed the model simulation under two scenarios: undisturbed and disturbed. The undisturbed scenario aimed to simulate potential plant growth and functioning with natural levels of atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen deposition, but the effects of anthropogenic forcing were simulated in the disturbed scenario. Results showed that the simulated H2O and CO2 fluxes are higher in the disturbed scenario than those in the undisturbed scenario, which suggests that anthropogenic forcing had an apparent effect on the water and carbon fluxes and sequestration capacity. However, simulation also indicated that nitrogen application from chemical fertiliser is greater than the requirements of crops, which might cause water and soil pollution in the study area.","2005","2020-03-13 22:31:10","2020-10-10 01:23:37","","209–224","","","131","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Biome-BGC</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\REP7LW5A\Wang et al. - 2005 - Simulation of water and carbon fluxes using BIOME-.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Algorithms and models that link the properties of plant functional types, species groups, or single species to their impact on specific ecosystem services have been developed. However, these models require a considerable effort for initialization that is inherently related to uncertainties originating from the high diversity of plant species in urban areas. We therefore suggest a new automated method to be used with the i-Tree Eco model to derive light competition for individual trees and investigate the importance of this property. Since competition depends also on the species, which is difficult to determine from increasingly used remote sensing methodologies, we also investigate the impact of uncertain tree species classification on the ecosystem services by comparing a species-specific inventory determined by field observation with a genus-specific categorization and a model initialization for the dominant deciduous and evergreen species only. Our results show how the simulation of competition affects the determination of carbon sequestration, leaf area, and related ecosystem services and that the proposed method provides a tool for improving estimations. Misclassifications of tree species can lead to large deviations in estimates of ecosystem impacts, particularly concerning biogenic volatile compound emissions. In our test case, monoterpene emissions almost doubled and isoprene emissions decreased to less than 10% when species were estimated to belong only to either two groups instead of being determined by species or genus. It is discussed that this uncertainty of emission estimates propagates further uncertainty in the estimation of potential ozone formation.

The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of the process-based biogeochemical model Biome-BGC for application in central European forests from the lowlands to upper treeline as a pre-requisite for environmental impact assessments. We analyzed model behavior along an altitudinal gradient across the alpine treeline, which provided insights on the sensitivity of simulated average carbon pools to changes in environmental factors. A second set of tests included medium-term (30 years) simulations of carbon fluxes, and a third set of tests focused on daily carbon and water fluxes. Model results were compared to aboveground biomass measurements, leaf area index recordings as well as net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) measurements. The simulated medium-term forest growth agreed well with measured data. Also daily NEE fluxes were simulated adequately in most cases. Problems were detected when simulating ecosystems close to the upper timberline (overestimation of measured growth and pool sizes), and when simulating daily AET fluxes (overestimation of measured fluxes). The results showed that future applications of Biome-BGC could benefit much from an improvement of model algorithms (e.g., the Q10 model for respiration) as well as from a detailed analysis of the ecological significance of crucial parameters (e.g., the canopy water interception coefficient).","2006","2020-03-11 20:02:13","2020-10-08 23:50:42","","167-180","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Biome</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\L883AZLE\Schmid et al. - 2006 - Analyzing the carbon dynamics of central European .pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Insect epidemics, wildfires, and timber harvest have greatly affected North American C budgets in the last century. Research is needed to understand how forest C dynamics (source duration and recovery time) following disturbance vary as a function of disturbance type, severity, forest type, and initial C stocks. We used the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) to simulate total C stocks (excluding soil) for 100 years following three types of disturbance (fire, harvest, and insects) with four levels of severity. We initiated the model using empirical data from a large representative sample of forest conditions on the national forest ownership in the Rocky Mountain region (Forest Inventory and Analysis data). Unlike analyses based on stand age, an ambiguous quantity with respect to disturbance history, our approach enables explicit consideration of disturbance type and severity, as well as pre-disturbance forest C. On average, stands became a C sink after fire in 5, 6, 14, and 23 years for low to high-severity fire. Pre-fire C stocks were reached 25–55 years later. Following bark beetle epidemics, on average stands continued to be a C source for 10 years longer than fire and up to 40 years longer in some cases, but pre-disturbance C stocks were reached in a similar amount of time. C stocks following harvest showed the largest initial decline, but on average stands became a sink sooner at 1, 5, 15, and 12 years post-harvest for low to high-severity harvests. Differences in C dynamics based on disturbance type and severity, initial conditions, and forest type demonstrate the importance of considering this variability when modeling forest C dynamics. The regionally averaged models of C response quantified in this study can be combined with remotely sensed data on disturbance type and severity and used with C accounting approaches that rely on growth and yield or state and transition models.","2014","2020-02-27 19:12:45","2020-10-08 19:06:40","","21-34","","","336","","","","","","","","","","En","","","","","","","","<p>ForCaMF</p>","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8RUV5M34\Raymond et al. - 2014 - Representative regional models of post-disturbance.pdf","","Fire; Modeling; Journal Article; Growth; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Between 1950 and 2009, upland and wetland (i.e., terrestrial) ecosystems of the state gained 0.4 Tg C/yr (0.1% of net primary production, NPP), resulting in a cumulative greenhouse gas radiative forcing of 1.68 x 10(-3) W/m(2). The change in carbon storage is spatially variable with the region of the Northwest Boreal Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) losing carbon because of fire disturbance. The combined carbon transport via various pathways through inland aquatic ecosystems of Alaska was estimated to be 41.3 Tg C/yr (17% of terrestrial NPP). During the projection period (2010-2099), carbon storage of terrestrial ecosystems of Alaska was projected to increase (22.5-70.0 Tg C/yr), primarily because of NPP increases of 10-30% associated with responses to rising atmospheric CO2, increased nitrogen cycling, and longer growing seasons. Although carbon emissions to the atmosphere from wildfire and wetland CH4 were projected to increase for all of the climate projections, the increases in NPP more than compensated for those losses at the statewide level. Carbon dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems continue to warm the climate for four of the six future projections and cool the climate for only one of the projections. The attribution analyses we conducted indicated that the response of NPP in terrestrial ecosystems to rising atmospheric CO2 (similar to 5% per 100 ppmv CO2) saturates as CO2 increases (between approximately +150 and +450 ppmv among projections). This response, along with the expectation that permafrost thaw would be much greater and release large quantities of permafrost carbon after 2100, suggests that projected carbon gains in terrestrial ecosystems of Alaska may not be sustained. From a national perspective, inclusion of all of Alaska in greenhouse gas inventory reports would ensure better accounting of the overall greenhouse gas balance of the nation and provide a foundation for considering mitigation activities in areas that are accessible enough to support substantive deployment.","2018-09","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-07 22:42:58","","1396-1412","","6","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000443555100002","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\BZV8WTGI\McGuire et al. - 2018 - Assessing historical and projected carbon balance .pdf","","Management; Pools; Journal Article; Alaska; Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We coupled fire disturbance and biogeochemical models to assess the relative effects of changing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), climate, logging and fire regimes on the historical and future C balance of upland ecosystems for the four main Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) of Alaska. At the end of the historical period (1950–2009) of our analysis, we estimate that upland ecosystems of Alaska store ~50 Pg C (with ~90% of the C in soils), and gained 3.26 Tg C/yr. Three of the LCCs had gains in total ecosystem C storage, while the Northwest Boreal LCC lost C (6.01 Tg C/yr) because of increases in fire activity. Carbon exports from logging affected only the North Pacific LCC and represented less than 1% of the state’s net primary production (NPP). The analysis for the future time period (2010–2099) consisted of six simulations driven by climate outputs from two climate models for three emission scenarios. Across the climate scenarios, total ecosystem C storage increased between 19.5 and 66.3 Tg C/yr, which represents 3.4% to 11.7% increase in Alaska upland’s storage. We conducted additional simulations to attribute these responses to environmental changes. This analysis showed that atmospheric CO2 fertilization was the main driver of ecosystem C balance. By comparing future simulations with constant and with increasing atmospheric CO2, we estimated that the sensitivity of NPP was 4.8% per 100 ppmv, but NPP becomes less sensitive to CO2 increase throughout the 21st century. Overall, our analyses suggest that the decreasing CO2 sensitivity of NPP and the increasing sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration to air temperature, in addition to the increase in C loss from wildfires weakens the C sink from upland ecosystems of Alaska and will ultimately lead to a source of CO2 to the atmosphere beyond 2100. Therefore, we conclude that the increasing regional C sink we estimate for the 21st century will most likely be transitional.","2018-01","2020-02-21 18:09:41","2021-12-03 19:00:03","2020-02-21 18:09:41","5-27","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\A2EIB5PZ\Genet et al. - 2018 - The role of driving factors in historical and proj.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Alaska; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We designed 12 scenarios combining possible changes in tree growth rates, decay rates, and area burned by wildﬁre with forecasts of future harvest to quantify the uncertainty of future (2010–2080), timber growing stock, ecosystem C stock, and greenhouse gas (GHG) balance for 67 million ha of forest in British Columbia, Canada. Each scenario was simulated 100 times with the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3). Depending on the scenario, timber growing stock over the entire land-base may increase by 14% or decrease by 9% by 2080 (a range of 2.8 billion m3), relative to 2010. However, timber growing stock available for harvest was forecast to decline in all scenarios by 26–62% relative to 2010 (a range of 1.2 billion m3). Forests were an annual GHG source in 2010 due to an ongoing insect outbreak. If half of the C in harvested wood was assumed to be immediately emitted, then 0–95% of simulations returned to annual net sinks by 2040, depending on scenario, and the cumulative (2010–2080) GHG balance ranged from a sink of -4.5 Pg CO2e (-67 Mg CO2e ha-1) for the most optimistic scenario, to a source of 4.5 Pg CO2e (67 Mg CO2e ha-1) for the most pessimistic. The difference in total ecosystem carbon stocks between the most optimistic and pessimistic scenarios in 2080 was 2.4 Pg C (36 Mg C ha-1), an average difference of 126 Tg CO2e yr-1 (2 Mg CO2e yr-1 ha-1) over the 70-year simulation period, approximately double the total reported anthropogenic GHG emissions in British Columbia in 2008. Forests risk having reduced growing stock and being GHG sources under many foreseeable scenarios, thus providing further feedback to climate change. These results indicate the need for continued monitoring of forest responses to climatic and global change, the development of mitigation and adaptation strategies by forest managers, and global efforts to minimize climate change impacts on forests.","2011-09","2020-01-21 19:55:54","2021-02-17 00:07:09","2020-01-21 19:55:54","827-837","","5","262","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\VACZWPYX\Metsaranta et al. - 2011 - Uncertainty of 21st century growing stocks and GHG.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Flux; British Columbia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BC forest biomass has also become a major source of wood pellets, exported primarily for bioenergy to Europe, although the sustainability and net carbon emissions of forest bioenergy in general are the subject of current debate. We simulated the temporal carbon balance of BC wood pellets against different reference scenarios for forests affected by MPB in the interior BC timber harvesting area using the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3). We evaluated the carbon dynamics for different insect-mortality levels, at the stand- and landscape level, taking into account carbon storage in the ecosystem, wood products and fossil fuel displacement. Our results indicate that current harvesting practices, in which slash is burnt and only sawdust used for pellet production, require between 20-25 years for beetle-impacted pine and 37-39 years for sprucedominated systems to reach pre - harvest carbon levels (i.e. break-even) at the stand-level. Using pellets made from logging slash to replace coal creates immediate net carbon beneﬁts to the atmosphere of 17–21 tonnes C ha -1, shortening these break-even times by 9–20 years and resulting in an instant carbon break-even level on stands most severely impacted by the beetle. Harvesting pine dominated sites for timber while using slash for bioenergy was also found to be more carbon beneﬁcial than a protection reference scenario on both stand- and landscape level. However, harvesting stands exclusively for bioenergy resulted in a net carbon source unless the system contained a high proportion of dead trees (>85%).

This model of carbon-dynamics implements a Tier 3 approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Good Practice Guidance for reporting on carbon stocks and carbon stock changes resulting from Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). The CBMCFS3 is a generic modelling framework that can be applied at the stand, landscape and national levels. The model provides a spatially referenced, hierarchical system for integrating datasets originating from different forest inventory and monitoring programs and includes a structure that allows for tracking of land areas by different land-use and landuse change classes. Ecosystem pools in CBM-CFS3 can be easily mapped to IPCC-defined pools and validated against field measurements. The model uses sophisticated algorithms for converting volume to biomass and explicitly simulates individual annual disturbance events (natural and anthropogenic). Several important scientific updates have been made to improve the representation of ecosystem structure and processes from previous versions of CBM-CFS. These include: (1) an expanded representation of dead organic matter and soil carbon, particularly standing dead trees, and a new algorithm for initializing these pools prior to simulation, (2) a change in the input data requirement for simulating growth from biomass to readily available merchantable volume curves, and new algorithms for converting volume to biomass, (3) improved prediction of belowground biomass, and (4) improved parameters for soil organic matter decay, fire, insect disturbances, and forest management. In addition, an operational-scale version of CBM-CFS3 is freely available and includes tools to import data in standard formats, including the output of several timber supply models that are commonly used in Canada. Although developed for Canadian forests, the flexible nature of the model has enabled it to be adapted for use in several other countries.","2009","2019-12-19 16:56:47","2021-12-08 16:45:40","","480-504","","","220","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\4XXZKNV3\Kurz et al. - 2009 - CBM-CFS3 A model of carbon-dynamics in forestry a.pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Journal Article; Flux; Land use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The greenhouse gas balance of Canada's managed forest is strongly affected by naturally occurring fire with high interannual variability in the area burned and by cyclical insect outbreaks. Taking these stochastic future disturbances into account, we used the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3) to project that the managed forests of Canada could be a source of between 30 and 245 Mt CO(2)e yr(-1) during the first Kyoto Protocol commitment period (2008-2012). The recent transition from sink to source is the result of large insect outbreaks. The wide range in the predicted greenhouse gas balance (215 Mt CO(2)e yr(-1)) is equivalent to nearly 30% of Canada's emissions in 2005. The increasing impact of natural disturbances, the two major insect outbreaks, and the Kyoto Protocol accounting rules all contributed to Canada's decision not to elect forest management. In Canada, future efforts to influence the carbon balance through forest management could be overwhelmed by natural disturbances. Similar circumstances may arise elsewhere if global change increases natural disturbance rates. Future climate mitigation agreements that do not account for and protect against the impacts of natural disturbances, for example, by accounting for forest management benefits relative to baselines, will fail to encourage changes in forest management aimed at mitigating climate change.","2008-02-05","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-07 18:12:05","","1551-1555","","5","105","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000253077900032","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\6VLMEQE9\Kurz et al. - 2008 - Risk of natural disturbances makes future contribu.pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; Flux; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large- scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks(4). Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000 - 2020 will be 270 megatonnes ( Mt) carbon ( or 36 g carbon m(-2) yr(-1) on average over 374,000 km 2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to similar to 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959 - 1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change(5). Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak(6). Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large- scale modelling analyses.","2008-04-24","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2020-10-07 18:12:05","","987-990","","7190","452","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000255208600038","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\DB8GMSFM\Kurz et al. - 2008 - Mountain pine beetle and forest carbon feedback to.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Disturbance; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We calibrated MC2 using the best available spatial datasets from land managers. We ran future simulations using climate projections from four global circulation models (GCM) under representative concentration pathway 8.5. Under this scenario, forest productivity is projected to increase as the growing season lengthens, and ﬁre occurrence is projected to increase steeply throughout the century, with burned area peaking early- to mid-century. Subalpine forests are projected to disappear, and the coniferous forests to contract by 32.8%. Large portions of the dry and mesic forests are projected to convert to woodlands, unless precipitation were to increase. Low levels of change are projected for the Umatilla National Forest consistently across the four GCM’s. For the WallowaWhitman and the Malheur National Forest, forest conversions are projected to vary more across the four GCMbased simulations, reﬂecting high levels of uncertainty arising from climate.

Adaptation studies of forestry practices have focused on maintaining the provisioning of ecosystem services; however, those practices may have implications for climate change mitigation as well by increasing biological sinks or reducing emissions. Assessments of the effectiveness of adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change are therefore needed; however, they have not been done for the world’s northern coniferous forests. Diversifying the forest by planting tree species more likely suited to a future climate is a potential adaptation strategy to increase resilience. The efﬁcacy of this strategy to reduce the risks of climate change is uncertain, and other ecosystem services provided by the forest are also likely to be affected. We used a spatially explicit forest landscape modeling framework (LANDIS-II) to simulate the effects of planting a range of native tree species in colder areas than where they are currently planted in a managed temperate coniferous forest landscape in British Columbia, Canada. We investigated impacts on carbon pools, ﬂuxes, tree species diversity, and harvest levels under different climate scenarios for 100 yr (2015–2115) and found that the capacity of our forest landscape to sequester carbon would largely depend on the precipitation rates in the future, rather than on temperature. We further found that, irrespective of the climate prediction model, current planting standards led to relatively low levels of resilience as indicated by carbon ﬂuxes and stocks, net primary productivity (NPP), and species diversity. In contrast, planting a mix of alternative tree species was generally superior in increasing the resilience indicators: carbon stocks and ﬂuxes, NPP, and tree species diversity, but not harvest rates. The second best novel planting regime involved adding Pinus contorta to the stocking standard in three ecoregions; however, that species is susceptible to a high number of insects and pathogens. We conclude that although the capacity of temperate coniferous forest landscapes to sequester carbon in the future is largely dependent on the precipitation regime, negative effects may be counteracted to some extent by increasing resilience through tree species diversity in forests.","2017-11","2020-01-21 19:55:32","2020-10-07 00:38:36","2020-01-21 19:55:32","e01981","","11","8","","","Climate change mitigation through adaptation","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\PMQ9SCEN\Hof et al. - 2017 - Climate change mitigation through adaptation the .pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This makes it difficult to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) consequences of different forest management or manufacturing activities that maintain the storage of carbon. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) addresses this issue by allowing other accounting methods. The objective of this paper is to provide a new model for estimating annual stock changes of carbon in harvested wood products (HWP). Results: The model, British Columbia Harvested Wood Products version 1 (BC-HWPv1), estimates carbon stocks and fluxes for wood harvested in BC from 1965 to 2065, based on new parameters on local manufacturing, updated and new information for North America on consumption and disposal of wood and paper products, and updated parameters on methane management at landfills in the USA. Based on model results, reporting on emissions as they occur would substantially lower BC’s greenhouse gas inventory in 2010 from 48 Mt CO2 to 26 Mt CO2 because of the long-term forest carbon storage in-use and in the non-degradable material in landfills. In addition, if offset projects created under BC’s protocol reported 100 year cumulative emissions using the BC-HWPv1 the emissions would be lower by about 11%. Conclusions: This research showed that the IPCC default methods overestimate the emissions North America wood products. Future IPCC GHG accounting methods could include a lower emissions factor (e.g. 0.52) multiplied by the annual harvest, rather than the current multiplier of 1.0. The simulations demonstrated that the primary opportunities for climate change mitigation are in shifting from burning mill waste to using the wood for longer-lived products.","2012-12","2020-01-21 19:55:22","2021-12-07 19:40:33","2020-01-21 19:55:22","","","1","7","","","Forest carbon in North America","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\6WMM5KCR\Dymond - 2012 - Forest carbon in North America annual storage and.pdf","","Management; Modeling; Journal Article; Flux; Harvest; British Columbia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, those opportunities may be confounded by negative climate change impacts. We therefore need a better understanding of climate change alterations to temperate forest carbon dynamics before developing mitigation strategies. The purpose of this project was to investigate the interactions of species composition, ﬁre, management, and climate change in the Copper–Pine Creek valley, a temperate coniferous forest with a wide range of growing conditions. To do so, we used the LANDIS-II modelling framework including the new Forest Carbon Succession extension to simulate forest ecosystems under four different productivity scenarios, with and without climate change effects, until 2050. Signiﬁcantly, the new extension allowed us to calculate the net sector productivity, a carbon accounting metric that integrates aboveground and belowground carbon dynamics, disturbances, and the eventual fate of forest products. The model output was validated against literature values. The results implied that the species optimum growing conditions relative to current and future conditions strongly inﬂuenced future carbon dynamics. Warmer growing conditions led to increased carbon sinks and storage in the colder and wetter ecoregions but not necessarily in the others. Climate change impacts varied among species and site conditions, and this indicates that both of these components need to be taken into account when considering climate change mitigation activities and adaptive management. The introduction of a new carbon indicator, net sector productivity, promises to be useful in assessing management effectiveness and mitigation activities.","2016-03-30","2020-01-21 19:55:16","2020-10-06 17:24:47","2020-01-21 19:55:16","1933-1947","","6","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\CECUAV5A\Dymond et al. - 2016 - Carbon sequestration in managed temperate conifero.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Sequestration; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We estimated that from 2000 to 2011, on average 9.4 Mt of wood ﬁbre (ovendry) was used annually to produce energy, which was about one-third of the total harvested biomass. However, bioenergy does not drive the harvest. Bioenergy uses residual ﬁbre from other operations primarily black liquor from pulp mills. In total, the forest sector produced approximately 118 PJ of thermal and electrical energy in 2011, based on the net caloriﬁc value provided by respondents.

To illuminate tradeoffs relevant to policymakers, forest sector stakeholders, and consumers of forest products, we utilize three Key Performance Indicators - average carbon storage in the forest and wood products; cumulative timber output; and discounted cash ﬂow - to compare four alternative management scenarios for Douglas-ﬁr forests on 64 parcels across western Oregon and Washington. These scenarios are designed to meet one of two alternative management objectives: (i) maximize Net Present Value; or (ii) maximize sustained timber yield; according to one of two alternative sets of forest practice constraints: (i) compliance with minimum Oregon/Washington Forest Practices Act (FPA) rules; or (ii) two key requirements (increased green tree retention and wider riparian buffers) of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certiﬁcation. Improved performance in terms of carbon storage for these alternatives generally also corresponded with reduced Net Present Value and timber yields. The gap between FSC and FPA performance indicators was wider in Oregon than Washington, which is primarily attributed to the higher level of stream protection required under Washington versus Oregon FPA rules. We observed consistently higher average carbon storage per cumulative timber output among FSC scenarios relative to business-as-usual, indicating FSC-certiﬁed wood carries an embedded carbon beneﬁt. Our ﬁndings highlight options for targeted policies to incentivize management that increases carbon storage and minimizes disruptions in timber output, as well as for narrowing the ﬁnancial gap (or opportunity cost) that would be involved in a transition away from contemporary common practice on industrial timberlands in the coastal Douglas-ﬁr forests of the Paciﬁc Northwest.","2018-07-25","2020-01-21 19:55:01","2021-02-25 16:33:55","2020-01-21 19:55:01","447","","8","9","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\AA79XSW6\Diaz et al. - 2018 - Tradeoffs in Timber, Carbon, and Cash Flow under A.pdf","","Management; Biomass; Pools; Journal Article; Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Total biomass carbon (sum of all the pools) was significantly lower 1 year post-treatment than pre-treatment and returned to 97% of pre-treatment levels by 8 year post-treatment primarily from increases in the tree carbon pool. Prescribed fire reduced predicted wildfire emissions by 45% the first year after treatment and remained reduced through 8 year post-treatment (34%). Net carbon (total biomass minus simulated wildfire emissions) resulted in a source (10.4-15.4 Mg ha(-1)) when field-derived values were compared to simulated controls for all post-treatment time periods. However, the incidence of potential crown fire in the untreated simulations was at least double for the 2 year and 8 year post-treatment time periods than in the treated plots. We also compared field-derived estimates to simulated values using the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS). In our validation of FFE-FVS to predict carbon stocks, the model performed well for the total biomass carbon (4% difference); however, there was great variability within the individual carbon pools. Live tree carbon had the highest correlation between field-derived and simulated values, and dead tree carbon the lowest correlation and highest percent differences followed by herb and shrub carbon.

Yet, forest C density varies greatly in space, both globally and at stand and landscape levels. Understanding the multi-scale drivers of this variation is a prerequisite for robust and effective climate change mitigation in ecosystem management. Here, we used airborne light detection and ranging (Lidar) and a novel high-resolution simulation model of landscape dynamics (iLand) to identify the drivers of variation in C density for an old-growth forest landscape in Oregon, USA. With total ecosystem C in excess of 1 Gt ha(-1) these ecosystems are among the most C-rich globally. Our findings revealed considerable spatial variability in stand-level C density across the landscape. Notwithstanding the distinct environmental gradients in our mountainous study area only 55.3% of this variation was explained by environmental drivers, with radiation and soil physical properties having a stronger influence than temperature and precipitation. The remaining variation in C stocks was largely attributable to emerging properties of stand dynamics (that is, stand structure and composition). Not only were density- and size-related indicators positively associated with C stocks but also diversity in composition and structure, documenting a close link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We conclude that the complexity of old-growth forests contributes to their sustained high C levels, a finding that is relevant to managing forests for climate change mitigation.","2012-12","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-09 01:33:22","","1321-1335","","8","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000312143300009","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\6AJPCLVU\Seidl et al. - 2012 - Multi-scale Drivers of Spatial Variation in Old-Gr.pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in dry temperate forests, wildfire is a natural disturbance agent with the potential to release large fluxes of C into the atmosphere. Climate-driven increases in wildfire extent and severity are expected to increase the risks of reversal to C stores and affect the potential of dry forests to sequester C. In the western United States, fuel treatments that successfully reduce surface fuels in dry forests can mitigate the spread and severity of wildfire, while reducing both tree mortality and emissions from wildfire. However, heterogeneous burn environments, site-specific variability in post-fire ecosystem response, and uncertainty in future fire frequency and extent complicate assessments of long-term (decades to centuries) C dynamics across large landscapes. Results of studies on the effects of fuel treatments and wildfires on long-term C retention across large landscapes are limited and equivocal. Stand-scale studies, empirical and modeled, describe a wide range of total treatment costs (12-116 Mg C ha(-1)) and reductions in wildfire emissions between treated and untreated stands (1-40 Mg C ha(-1)). Conclusions suggest the direction (source, sink) and magnitude of net C effects from fuel treatments are similarly variable (-33 Mg C ha(-1) to +3 Mg C ha(-1)). Studies at large spatial and temporal scales suggest that there is a low likelihood of high-severity wildfire events interacting with treated forests, negating any expected C benefit from fuels reduction. The frequency, extent, and severity of wildfire are expected to increase as a result of changing climate, and additional information on C response to management and disturbance scenarios is needed improve the accuracy and usefulness of assessments of fuel treatment and wildfire effects on C dynamics.

We fit empirical models to chronosequences of forest inventory data at two scales: a coarse-scale ecosystem classification (ecosections) and forest types (potential vegetation) within ecosections. We hypothesized that analysis at the finer scale of forest types would reduce variability, yielding better fitting models. We fit models for three temporal dynamics: accumulation of live biomass, accumulation of dead biomass, and net primary productivity (NPP). We compared fitted model parameters among ecosections and among forest types to determine differences in potential C storage and uptake. Models of live biomass C accumulation and NPP fit the data better at the scale of forest types, suggesting this finer scale is important for reducing variability. Model fit for dead biomass C accumulation depended more on the region than on the scale of analysis. Dead biomass C was highly variable and a relationship with forest age was found only in some forest types of the eastern Cascades and Okanogan Highlands. Indicators of C storage potential differed between forest types and differences were consistent with expectations based on spatial variability in climate. Across the study area, maximum live biomass C varied from 6.5 to 38.6 kg C m(-2) and the range of ages at which 90% of maximum is reached varied from 57 to 838 years. Maximum NPP varied from 0.37 to 0.94 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) and the age of maximum NPP varied from 65 to 543 yrs. Forests with the greatest C storage potential are wet forests of the western Cascades. Forests with the greatest potential NPP are 65-100-year-old mesic western redcedar-western hemlock forests and riparian forests, although limited data suggest maximum NPP of coastal sitka spruce forests may be even greater. The observed relationship between the ages at which maximum NPP and maximum live biomass are reached for a given forest type suggests that there is a trade-off between managing for maximum live biomass (storage) vs. NPP (uptake) in some forest types but an optimal age for C management in others. The empirical models of C dynamics in this study can be used to quantify the effects of age-class distributions on C storage and NPP for large areas composed of different forest types. Also, the models can be used to test the effects of current or future natural and anthropogenic disturbance regimes on C sequestration, providing an alternative to biogeochemical process models and stand-scale methods.

Several methods have been used to measure carbon fractions, yet no comprehensive comparison between methods has been performed. We found significant differences between carbon fractions derived from four sample preparation methods: oven-drying, vacuum desiccation, freeze-drying, and a new method that consisted of (i) not drying samples, (ii) cutting samples instead of grinding them, (iii) measuring carbon content of samples, (iv) oven-drying remaining sample material and (v) using mass measurements of remaining sample material before and after oven-drying to adjust measured carbon fraction values to an oven-dry basis (minimize the loss of carbon (MLC) method). Oven-drying, freeze-drying and vacuum desiccation resulted in lower average carbon fraction estimates than the MLC method, suggesting that they do not capture as much of the carbon present in tree tissues. Further analysis showed significant, though small, differences in carbon fractions between powdered samples and samples excised from tree core segments with a razor blade. Powdered samples were found to have lower carbon fractions than the excised samples, indicating that some carbon is lost when samples are powdered instead of cut. Utilization of the MLC method captured an average of 1.4% more carbon on an oven-drying basis than freeze-drying, the next best method. Additionally, when applied to different tree tissue types, these methods measured different volatile carbon fractions, indicating that studies attempting to quantify volatile carbon and total carbon fraction in trees should measure all tissue types present.","2016-09","2019-10-08 18:31:49","2020-10-07 17:17:13","","1177-1189","","9","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000387902800010","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\E3EEPDNP\Jones and O'Hara - 2016 - The influence of preparation method on measured ca.pdf","","Journal Article; Carbon fraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both abiotic resource availability and biotic interactions during forest succession affect C accumulation rates and maximum C stocks. However, the timing and controls on the peak and decline in C accumulation rates as stands age, trees increase in size, and canopy gaps become prevalent are not well-understood. Our study examines measured change in live and dead woody C pools from 8767 inventory plots on 9.1 million ha of Pacific Northwest National Forest lands to determine how the balance of tree growth, mortality, and dead wood decomposition varied by stand age, plant community type, and site productivity; and to compare the contribution of different tree sizes to C accumulation. Maximum non-mineral soil C for old-growth stands varied significantly by productivity class within plant community types, but on average stands accumulated 75% of maximum stocks by age 127 +/- 35 yr. We did not see a decline in net primary production of wood (NPPw) with age in moderate and low-productivity classes, but found a 33% reduction in high-productivity classes. Mortality increased with stand age such that net change in live tree biomass, and change in total woody C, was not significantly different from zero in old-growth stands over age 400 (0.15 +/- 0.64 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1) for woody C). However, significant though modest C accumulation was found in forests 200-400 yr old (0.34-0.70 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1), depending on age class). Mortality of trees >100 cm diameter exceeded or equaled NPPw, but trees were growing into the larger sizes at a high-enough rate that a net increase in large tree C was seen across the region. Although large trees accumulated C at a faster rate than small trees on an individual basis, their contribution to C accumulation rates was smaller on an area basis, and their importance relative to small trees declined in older stands compared to younger stands. In contrast to recent syntheses, our results suggest that old-growth and large trees are important C stocks, but they play a minor role in additional C accumulation.","2016-01","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-06 22:54:31","","e01224","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000374895800004","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\KF9SY3T5\Gray et al. - 2016 - Carbon stocks and accumulation rates in Pacific No.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current official estimates of forest C flux are based on a combination of field measurements and other methods. The goal of this study was to improve on existing methods by directly tracking components of change in tree C across a large region using field measurements. We used repeated Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) measurements on permanent plots to quantify aboveground live tree C flux over an 11-year period due to land-use change, disturbance, and harvest, on 1,073 plots across 5.96 million ha of nonfederal forestland in Oregon. Land-use change resulted in a 110,000 ha (1.9%) net increase of forestland between 1986 and 1997. However, there was a net loss of 3.4 Tg of live tree C due to land-use change because the forestland lost was more productive than that gained. Live woody C decreased significantly in eastern Oregon (-14.4 Tg), with mortality and harvest exceeding growth, primarily due to severe defoliation by western spruce budworm. However, C stores increased significantly in western Oregon (19.2 Tg) due primarily to large accumulations from growth on nonfederal public lands. We demonstrate that C accounting that uses remeasured probabilistic field sample data can produce detailed estimates of C flux that identify causes and components of change and produce more consistent estimates than alternative approaches.","2014-04","2019-05-16 22:26:51","2020-10-06 22:54:14","","317-326","","2","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000334145400013","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\FP5CNJZV\Gray et al. - 2014 - Estimation of Aboveground Forest Carbon Flux in Or.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Flux; Oregon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to sustaining natural resources, these lands are managed for multiple objectives that do not always align with maximizing carbon (C) sequestration. The objectives of this study were to determine C stocks and flux in measured pools on Pacific Northwest Region NFS lands and the major ecological drivers of C flux. We compiled tree, dead wood, and understory vegetation data from 11,435 systematically-placed inventory plots and estimated growth, mortality, decay, removals, and disturbance events based on two full measurements spanning 1993-2007. The area of NFS-administered lands increased by 0.3% during this period and the area in formally-designated protected status increased by 0.7%. There was 1293 Tg C (+/- 11.2 Tg standard error) in non-soil C stocks at the first measurement, which increased by 45 +/- 2.2 Tg (3.4%), with 59% of the increase in the live tree pool and the remainder in the dead tree pools. C stocks followed broad regional patterns in productivity while C flux varied at local scales. Fires affected <1% of the forested area per year and were most prevalent in Wilderness areas. Fires reduced C stocks on burned plots by only 9%, and had a negligible effect on the region as a whole. Most tree harvest on NFS lands in the region consisted of partial harvest and had comparable impacts to fire during this period.

We discuss challenges to estimating forest ecosystem carbon stocks, which requires the application of a large number of equations and parameters for measured and unmeasured components, some with scant empirical support.

Occupying one-third of the earth's land area, forest vegetation and soils contain about 60% of the total terrestrial C. Forest biomass productivity can be enhanced by management practices, which suggests that, by this means, forests could store more C globally and thereby slow the increase in atmospheric CO2. The question is how much C can be sequestered by forest and agroforest management practices. To address the question, a global database of information was compiled to assess quantitatively the potential of forestry practices to sequester C. The database presently has information for 94 forested nations that represent the boreal, temperate and tropical latitudes. Results indicate that the most promising management practices are reforestation in the temperate and tropical latitudes, afforestation in the temperate regions, and agroforestry and natural reforestation in the tropics. Across all practices, the median of the mean C storage values for the boreal latitudes is 16 tCha-1 (n=46) while in the temperate and tropical latitudes the median values are 71 tCha-1 (n=401) and 66 tCha-1 (n=170), respectively. Preliminary projections are that if these practices were implemented on 0.6 to 1.2 x 10(9) ha of available land over a 50-yr period, approximately 50 to 100 GtC could be sequestered.","1992-08","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2021-12-06 18:16:38","","213-227","","1-2","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1992JA71500014","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\7338I6UL\Winjum et al. - 1992 - Estimating the global potential of forest and agro.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Sequestration; Silviculture; Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, forest carbon pools and flux for timberlands in the conterminous United States were projected over the coming 50 years by coupling a forest economics model, a forest inventory model and a forest carbon model. In the base case scenario, US forests sequestered carbon in the 1990s at a rate of 80 Tg yr(-1) but came close to carbon equilibrium by the 2020s. The dominant factors driving this change were an increasing forest harvest, a decreasing forest land base, and a reduction in average stand age. Scenarios in which alternative forest policy options were implemented related to increased paper recycling and increased afforestation (5x10(6) ha) produced long-term increases in carbon sequestration on the forest land base of up to 15 Tg yr(-1).

In a more detailed analysis of bioenergy strategies, two main effects have to be investigated: on the one hand, carbon in fossil fuels is substituted and thus not emitted to the atmosphere, while on the other hand, the use of biofuels might result in a reduction of carbon stored in the biosphere (plants, litter and soil). One of the possibilities to use biomass for energy is to burn logging residues from conventional forestry for heat and/or power production. For this type of bioenergy strategy, a model has been developed which allows one to calculate the change in carbon storage in three soil carbon pools and the carbon fluxes to and from these pools. The model results indicate that the carbon stored in the forest soil is reduced when logging residues are removed for bioenergy to displace fossil fuels. However, this effect is limited, as eventually a new equilibrium of carbon storage in the forest soil is reached, while fossil fuel substitution is continued further on. The time-dependent characteristic value 'carbon neutrality' (CN), which is the ratio of net emission reduction (fossil fuel substitution minus carbon losses of the soil) to the 'saved' carbon emissions from the substituted reference energy system, reflects this effect. CN equal to one means that bioenergy is completely 'CO2-neutral'. For bioenergy from logging residues, CN is very low at the beginning when bioenergy is introduced, increases continuously and approaches one at infinity. According to the results of parameter studies, CN of bioenergy from logging residues in temperate and boreal forests lies between 0.49 and 0.82 after 20 years and between 0.75 and 0.88 after 100 years.","1995","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2021-12-07 19:23:49","","221-234","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1995TH06600002","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\88QRAERJ\Schlamadinger et al. - 1995 - Carbon balance of bioenergey from logging residues.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Wood products; WD; Fuel wood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We suggest that trees are equally effective in preventing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere if they remove a unit of C from the atmosphere or if they supply a sustainable source of energy that substitutes for a unit of C discharged by burning fossil fuels. The model shows that the most effective strategy for using forest land to minimize increases in atmospheric CO2 will depend on the current status of the land, the productivity that can be expected, the efficiency with which the forest harvest is used to substitute for fossil fuels, and thc time perspective of the analysis. For forests with large standing biomass and low productivity the most effective strategy is to protect the existing forest. For land with little standing biomass and low productivity, the most effective strategy is to reforest or otherwise manage the land for forest growth and C storage. Where high productivity can be expected, thc most effective strategy is to manage the forest for a harvestable crop and to use the harvest with maximum efficiency either for long-lived products or to substitute for fossil fuels. The longer the time perspective, the more likely that harvesting and replanting will result in net C benefits.","1992-08","2019-10-29 21:42:24","2021-03-11 00:30:59","","181-195","","1-2","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:A1992JA71500012","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\HYP2PMHG\MARLAND and MARLAND - 1992 - Should we store carbon in trees.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Six case studies that represent different building functionalities, material systems, and construction techniques were modeled via the user interface input option, and the results were evaluated for global warming potential (GWP) and impacts on energy sources, such as fossil fuel consumption, when structural materials are substituted using wood. Out of the six case studies, one building was completely redesigned as per current codes using wood as the major structural material. Bills of materials for both wood redesigns and the as-built designs were used as input in the software and subsequently analyzed.

Quantifying the historical impacts of climate change and drought on ecosystem functions at the national scale is essential to develop sound forest management and watershed restoration plans under a changing climate. This study applied the previously validated Water Supply and Stress Index model (WaSSI) to 170 NFs in the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) to examine how historical extreme droughts have affected forest water yield (Q) and gross primary productivity (GPP). For each NF, we focused on the five years with the lowest annual SPI3 (Standardized Precipitation Index on a 3-month time scale) during 1962-2012. The extent of extreme droughts as measured by the number of NFs and total area affected by droughts has increased during the last decade. Across all lands in CONUS, the most extreme drought during the past decade occurred in 2002, resulting in a mean reduction of Q by 32% and GPP by 20%. For the 170 individual NFs, on average, the top-five droughts represented a reduction in precipitation by 145 mm yr(-1) (or 22%), causing reductions in evapotranspiration by 29 mm yr(-1) (or 8%), Q by 110 mm yr(-1) (or 37%) and GPP by 65 gC m(2) yr(-1) (or 9%). The responses of the forest hydrology and productivity to the top-five droughts varied spatially due to different land-surface characteristics (e.g., climatology and vegetation) and drought severity at each NF. This study provides a comprehensive benchmark assessment of likely drought impacts on the hydrology and productivity in NFs using consistent methods and datasets across the conterminous U.S. The study results are useful to the forestry decision makers for developing appropriate strategies to restore and protect ecosystem services in anticipating potential future droughts and climate change.

Long-term effects of forest density management on total aboveground C are not well understood, especially for precommercial thinning (PCT) implemented very early in stand development. To assess the climate change mitigation potential of PCT, as well as tradeoffs with climate change adaptation, we examined total aboveground C stores in a 54-year-old western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) precommercial thinning experiment to determine how different PCT treatments affect long-term aboveground C storage and distribution among pools. Four aboveground C pools (live over story, live understory/mid-story, woody detritus, and forest floor) were measured and separated into C accumulated prior to initiation of the current stand (legacy C) and C accumulated by the current stand (non-legacy C). PCT had no influence on the total non-legacy aboveground C stores 54 years after treatment. Live tree C was nearly identical across densities due to much larger trees in low density treatments. Low density stands had more understory and mid-story C while unthinned plots had significantly more non-legacy woody detritus C than thinned stands. Legacy pools did not vary significantly with density, but made up a substantial proportion of aboveground C stores. We found that: (1) fifty-four years after PCT total aboveground C is similar across treatments, due primarily to the increase in mean tree C of trees grown at lower stand densities; (2) deadwood legacies from the pre-disturbance forest still play an important role in long-term C storage 62 years after current stand initiation, accounting for approximately 20-25% of aboveground C stores; and (3) given enough time since early thinning, there is no trade-off between managing stands to promote individual tree growth and development of understory vegetation, and maximizing stand level accumulation of aboveground C over the long term. We infer that early PCT can be used to simultaneously achieve climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives, provided treatments are implemented early in stand development before canopy closure and the onset of intense intertree competition.

Differences in the sampling and quantification of dead wood can lead to differences in our understanding of forests and their role in the sequestration and emissions of CO2, as well as in developing appropriate strategies for achieving dead wood-related objectives, including biodiversity protection, and procurement of forest bioenergy feedstocks. A thorough understanding of the various methods available for quantifying dead wood stores and decomposition is critical for comparing studies and drawing valid conclusions. General assessments of forest dead wood are conducted by numerous countries as a part of their national forest inventories, while detailed experiments that employ field-based and modeling methods to understand woody debris patterns and processes have greatly advanced our understanding of dead wood dynamics. We review methods for quantifying dead wood in forest ecosystems, with an emphasis on biomass and carbon attributes. These methods encompass various sampling protocols for inventorying standing dead trees and downed woody debris, and an assortment of approaches for forecasting wood decomposition through time. Recent research has provided insight on dead wood attributes related to biomass and carbon content, through the use of structural reduction factors and robust modeling approaches, both of which have improved our understanding of dead wood dynamics. Our review, while emphasizing temperate forests, identifies key research needs and knowledge which at present impede our ability to accurately characterize dead wood populations. In sum, we synthesize the current literature on the measurement and dynamics of forest dead wood carbon stores and decomposition as a baseline for researchers and natural resource managers concerned about forest dead wood patterns and processes.

For such circumstances where complex interactions make it difficult to encompass the full range of processes in any one mode of analysis, expert elicitation is a well-developed method for documenting judgments about uncertainty, based on available evidence, to inform ongoing decision-making. Applying this method for the Sierra Nevada, we evaluate subjective probabilistic estimates of trends in aboveground forest carbon for different management scenarios toward the goal of maximizing carbon stored, while also considering implications for wildfire risk. The analysis examines the effects of four treatments in isolation (thinning, timber harvesting, prescribed burning, managed wildfire), as well as a user-defined management portfolio allocating resources across five management practices (thinning, harvesting, prescribed burning, firefighting, and restoration). The expert elicitation suggests that aboveground forest carbon stocks will decline 8%, from 126 to 116 tC/ha, between 2030 and 2100 (median estimate across experts) assuming conventional forest management practices are continued. Out of all surveyed practices, the custom user-defined management portfolio results in the highest carbon stock of 129 tC/ha which is 11% higher than conventional practice in 2100 at the 50th percentile. The expert elicitation indicates less beneficial carbon sequestration outcomes than recent modeling studies. Suggesting co-benefits across objectives, 75 experts collectively estimate a 61% likelihood that managing for carbon also reduces wildfire risk. By contrast, decreases in carbon stocks are anticipated for large magnitudes of climate change or substantial decreases in forest management investments.","2018-07","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-07 18:30:48","","e02321","","7","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000441526900019","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\9J2QWRDU\Lalonde et al. - 2018 - Forest management in the Sierra Nevada provides li.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; California; Survey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Insects and fungal diseases are important disturbances in forests, yet understanding of the role of drought in outbreaks of these agents is limited. Current knowledge concerning the effects of drought on herbivorous insect and pathogen outbreaks in U.S. forests is reviewed, and compared between the relatively mesic and structurally diverse forests of the eastern U.S. and the more xeric forests of the western U.S. Theory and limited evidence suggests a non-linear relationship between drought intensity and outbreaks of aggressive bark beetle species (i.e., those capable of causing extensive levels of tree mortality), where moderate droughts reduce bark beetle population performance and subsequent tree mortality, whereas intense droughts, which frequently occur in the western U.S., increase bark beetle performance and tree mortality. There is little evidence for a role of drought in outbreaks of the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis), the only bark beetle species that causes large amounts of tree mortality in the eastern U.S. Defoliators do not show consistent responses to drought. The response of sapfeeders to drought appears non-linear, with the greatest performance and impacts at intermediate drought intensity or when drought is alleviated by wetter periods. Interactions between tree pathogens and drought are poorly understood, but available evidence suggests reduced pathogen performance and host impacts in response to drought for primary pathogens and pathogens whose lifecycle depends directly on moisture (humidity). In these cases, rates of reproduction, spread, and infection tend to be greater when conditions are moist. In contrast, secondary fungal pathogens (i.e., those that depend on stressed hosts for colonization) are anticipated to respond to drought with greater performance and host impacts. In the western U.S., drought increases stress on trees severely infected by mistletoes thereby predisposing mistletoe-infected trees to attack by insects, particularly bark beetles and wood borers. Research needed to advance understanding of drought impacts on forest insects and diseases, and the role of forest management in mitigation of infestations during drought are discussed.

Individual-tree models have been commonly used, but the difficulties of reliably scaling from the individual to the stand level are often underestimated. Emergent properties and statistical issues limit their effectiveness. A more holistic modelling of aggregates at the whole stand level is a potentially attractive alternative. This work explores methodology for developing biologically consistent dynamic mixture models where the state is described by aggregate stand-level variables for species or age/size cohorts. The methods are demonstrated and tested with a two-cohort model for spruce aspen mixtures named SAM. The models combine single-species submodels and submodels for resource partitioning among the cohorts. The partitioning allows for differences in competitive strength among species and size classes, and for complementarity effects. Height growth reduction in suppressed cohorts is also modelled. SAM fits well the available data, and exhibits behaviors consistent with current ecological knowledge. The general framework can be applied to any number of cohorts, and should be useful as a basis for modelling other mixed-species or uneven-aged stands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies in boreal forests have assumed 50% C concentration or focused on species-specific C concentration estimation based on samples taken mostly from stemwood tissue of large trees. Yet, little is known about differences in C concentration between woody tissues or among trees of different sizes nor about the effects of life-history traits, such as shade tolerance and the role of volatile C on total C concentration in live trees. In this study, we examined variation in total and volatile C concentration in bark and stemwood tissues for trees of different sizes for six major North American boreal tree species. We found that bark had significantly higher total C and volatile C concentrations than stemwood and that both total C and volatile C concentration significantly varied among tree species. The average total C concentrations were 56.2% in the bark and 50.5% in the stem wood, and the average volatile C concentration were 5.8% and 3.0% for bark and stemwood, respectively. Furthermore, total C and volatile C concentration in stemwood and bark of almost all shade-intolerant species increased with tree size, whereas those of shade-tolerant species showed negative or neutral size-associated change.

Forests typically lose carbon for several years to several decades following severe disturbance, but our understanding of the duration and dynamics of post-disturbance forest carbon fluxes remains limited. Here we capitalize on a recent North American Carbon Program disturbance synthesis to discuss techniques and future work needed to better understand carbon dynamics after forest disturbance. Specifically, this paper addresses three topics: (1) the history, spatial distribution, and characteristics of different types of disturbance (in particular fire, insects, and harvest) in North America; (2) the integrated measurements and experimental designs required to quantify forest carbon dynamics in the years and decades after disturbance, as presented in a series of case studies; and (3) a synthesis of the greatest uncertainties spanning these studies, as well as the utility of multiple types of observations (independent but mutually constraining data) in understanding their dynamics. The case studies-in the southeast U. S., central boreal Canada, U. S. Rocky Mountains, and Pacific Northwest-explore how different measurements can be used to constrain and understand carbon dynamics in regrowing forests, with the most important measurements summarized for each disturbance type. We identify disturbance severity and history as key but highly uncertain factors driving post-disturbance carbon source-sink dynamics across all disturbance types. We suggest that imaginative, integrative analyses using multiple lines of evidence, increased measurement capabilities, shared models and online data sets, and innovative numerical algorithms hold promise for improved understanding and prediction of carbon dynamics in disturbance-prone forests.","2012-06-09","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-06 22:37:12","","G02022","","","117","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000305154100001","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8LYTUFFQ\Goetz et al. - 2012 - Observations and assessment of forest carbon dynam.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results indicated that the U.S. forest sector's projected capacities for carbon sequestration could be notably altered by use of forest resources for energy. A scenario with large expansion in U.S. wood energy consumption (16-fold increase by 2060) coupled with high global growth in gross domestic product would convert U.S. timberlands to a substantial carbon emission source by 2050, as timber growing stock inventories would be depleted because of increased biomass energy production. In contrast, the same high growth in the economy coupled with much smaller expansion of U.S. wood biomass energy consumption (less than two-fold increase by 2060) would result in a projected increase in average annual additions to U.S. forest sector carbon by up to four-fold by 2060. Results also indicated that higher cumulative carbon emissions from increased use of wood for energy could be partially offset-over time-by increased forest plantations and more intensive forest management that could be stimulated by the increased use of wood for energy. The modeling framework will enable future use of the USFPM/GFPM market modeling system to evaluate the impacts of forest carbon offset policies on forest carbon and forest products markets, by allowing carbon offset payments to compete in the model with forest products or wood energy for the control and use of available timber resources.

We review the environmental factors controlling their structure and global distribution and evaluate their current and future trajectory. Adaptations of trees to climate and resource gradients, coupled with disturbances and forest dynamics, create complex geographical patterns in forest assemblages and structures. These patterns are increasingly discernible through new satellite and airborne observation systems, improved forest inventories, and global ecosystem models. Forest biomass is a complex property affected by forest distribution, structure, and ecological processes. Since at least 1990, biomass density has consistently increased in global established forests, despite increasing mortality in some regions, suggesting that a global driver such as elevated CO2 may be enhancing biomass gains. Global forests have also apparently become more dynamic.

Using the national DWM inventory, attributes (e.g., carbon stock totals and biomass density) were summarized by state and common tree species along with evaluations of residue pile metrics and relationships between DWM and other stand attributes (e.g., live tree biomass, relative density, and climate). Results indicate that DWM are ubiquitous in US forests with individual components (e.g., fine woody debris and piles) varying by region as influenced by endemic ecosystem dynamics and management practices. Eastern forests, particularly in the southeast, have fine woody debris and residue piles biomass densities that often exceed those of west coast forests. Rocky Mountain forests have coarse woody biomass densities approaching those of west coast forests, which have the largest amounts nationally. There is a complex relationship between the standing dead, standing live, and down dead wood biomass densities per unit area in the context of changing stand relative densities and average annual precipitation/minimum temperatures. As evidenced by this initial exploration, a publicly available national dataset comprised of DWM attributes may inform decision makers with objective estimates of DWM resources and facilitate further DWM dynamics research.

Fires have received much attention in recent years as potential catalysts for shifting landscapes from carbon sinks to carbon sources. Unless structural or functional ecosystem shifts occur, net carbon balance in fire-adapted systems at steady state is zero when assessed over the entire post-fire successional sequence and at landscape scales. When evaluated at fine spatial scales and over short periods of time, however, wildfires may seem to release more carbon to the atmosphere than remains on site. Measurements of wildfire carbon emissions are thus highly biased by the spatial and temporal scales that bound them, and may over-or under-estimate carbon source-sink dynamics that provide critical feedbacks to the climate system. This synthesis paper provides a description of the ecological drivers of wildfires and carbon in forested ecosystems across the spatial and temporal scales at which system drivers (e.g., climate, weather), behaviors (e.g., wildfire occurrence, spread, intensity), and resulting patterns (e.g., vegetation composition and structure, carbon emissions) occur and interact. Improved understanding of these relationships is critical if we are to anticipate and respond to major changes in the global earth system expected in the coming decades and centuries.

It has been hypothesized that plants should maintain proportionally more biomass in the organ that acquires the most limiting resource. Accordingly, we hypothesize greater biomass distribution in roots and less in stems and foliage in increasingly arid climates and in colder environments at high latitudes. Such a strategy would increase uptake of soil water in dry conditions and of soil nutrients in cold soils, where they are at low supply and are less mobile. We use a large global biomass dataset (> 6,200 forests from 61 countries, across a 40 degrees C gradient in mean annual temperature) to address these questions. Climate metrics involving temperature were better predictors of biomass partitioning than those involving moisture availability, because, surprisingly, fractional distribution of biomass to roots or foliage was unrelated to aridity. In contrast, in increasingly cold climates, the proportion of total forest biomass in roots was greater and in foliage was smaller for both angiosperm and gymnosperm forests. These findings support hypotheses about adaptive strategies of forest trees to temperature and provide biogeographically explicit relationships to improve ecosystem and earth system models. They also will allow, for the first time to our knowledge, representations of root carbon pools that consider biogeographic differences, which are useful for quantifying whole-ecosystem carbon stocks and cycles and for assessing the impact of climate change on forest carbon dynamics.","2014-09-23","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-08 19:08:26","","13721-13726","","38","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000341988200026","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\FNQ3E24I\Reich et al. - 2014 - Temperature drives global patterns in forest bioma.pdf","","Biomass; Roots; Journal Article; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the effects of N-fertilization on production and consumption of greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in managed forest ecosystems are poorly understood, unlike in agriculture where effects are well documented. Therefore, a review of the available literature was conducted to comprehend the effects of N-fertilization on CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions in managed forest ecosystems to summarize sources, sinks, and controlling factors, as well as potential mitigation strategies and research gaps to reduce GHG emissions. This review clearly identifies the importance of N-fertilizer management practices on CO2, CH 4 and N2O emissions. Potential N management practices to mitigate GHG emissions in managed forest ecosystems include improving N uptake efficiency, identifying and managing spatial variation in soil fertility, using the right fertilizer source at the right time, adopting appropriate methods of N-fertilizer application, and introducing nitrification/denitrification inhibitors. Nitrogen-fertilizer response is affected by soil physical (e.g., moisture, drainage, bulk density, and texture), chemical (e.g., nutrient availability, labile carbon, soil pH, and C/N ratio) and local climatic factors (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall). Therefore, the interactions of these factors on GHG emissions need to be considered while evaluating N-fertilizer management practices. Existing studies are often limited, focusing primarily on temperate forest ecosystems, lacking estimation of net emissions considering all three predominant soil-derived GHGs, and were often conducted on a small scale, making upscaling challenging. Therefore, large-scale studies conducted in diverse climates, evaluating cumulative net emissions, are needed to better understand N-fertilization effects on GHG emissions and develop mitigation strategies. Mitigation strategies and research gaps have also been identified, which require the collaborative efforts of forest owners, managers, and scientists to increase adoption of N-fertilization best management practices and understand the importance of N-fertilizer management strategies in reducing emissions and enhancing the net GHG sink potential for managed forest ecosystems.","2015-03","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-09 17:19:56","","167-193","","2","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000352483100001","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\CDS2XN3V\Shrestha et al. - 2015 - Greenhouse gas emissions in response to nitrogen f.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Flux; Silviculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few reliable continental-scale modeling tools are available to account for both water and carbon dynamics. The objective of this study was to test a monthly water and carbon balance model, the Water Supply Stress Index (WaSSI) model, for potential application in addressing the influences of drought on NFs ecosystem services across the conterminous United States (CONUS). The performance of the WaSSI model was comprehensively assessed with measured streamflow (Q) at 72 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gauging stations, and satellite-based estimates of watershed evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary productivity (GPP) for 170 National Forest and Grassland (NFs). Across the 72 USGS watersheds, the WaSSI model generally captured the spatial variability of multi-year mean annual and monthly Q and annual ET as evaluated by Correlation Coefficient (R = 0.71-1.0), Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NS = 0.31-1.00), and normalized Root Mean Squared Error (0.06-0.48). The modeled ET and GPP by WaSSI agreed well with the remote sensing-based estimates for multi-year annual and monthly means for all the NFs. However, there were systemic discrepancies in GPP between our simulations and the satellite-based estimates on a yearly and monthly scale, suggesting uncertainties in GPP estimates in all methods (i.e., remote sensing and modeling). Overall, our assessments suggested that the WaSSI model had the capability to reconstruct the long-term forest watershed water and carbon balances at a broad scale. This model evaluation study provides a foundation for model applications in understanding the impacts of climate change and variability (e.g., droughts) on NFs ecosystem service functions.

To quantify the effect of harvesting on soil C, we used meta-analysis to examine a database of 945 responses to harvesting collected from 112 publications from around the world. Harvesting reduced soil C, on average, by 11.2% with 95% CI [14.1%, 8.5%]. There was substantial variation between responses in different soil depths, with greatest losses occurring in the O horizon (30.2%). Much smaller but still significant losses (3.3%) occurred in top soil C pools (0-15 cm depth). In very deep soil (60-100+ cm), a significant loss of 17.7% of soil C in was observed after harvest. However, only 21 of the 945 total responses examined this depth, indicating a substantial need for more research in this area. The response of soil C to harvesting varies substantially between soil orders, with greater losses in Spodosol and Ultisol orders and less substantial losses in Alfisols and Andisols. Soil C takes several decades to recover following harvest, with Spodosol and Ultisol C recovering only after at least 75 years. The publications in this analysis were highly skewed toward surface sampling, with a maximum sampling depth of 36 cm, on average. Sampling deep soil represents one of the best opportunities to reduce uncertainty in the understanding of the response of soil C to forest harvest.","2016-12","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2021-12-07 19:40:44","","308","","12","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000393327700008","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\A3YIIK6T\James and Harrison - 2016 - The Effect of Harvest on Forest Soil Carbon A Met.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Soil; Harvest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Step 1 measures the amount of biomass in piles from a variety of logging operations. Step 2 applies logistics models to determine the amount of biomass that is recoverable by computing the extraction costs depending on the distance from the landing. Cable units included only the biomass piles located at the landings, while ground-based units computed the collection and transport of each pile to the most cost-effective landing using geographic information system and simulation tools. This approach was applied to operations on state and private timberlands in Oregon and Washington. For the cable logging units, the average pile size was 46.7 green tonnes of residue, and this material was either on or next to the roadside landing. It produced few large piles with an average of 24.75 green tonnes per ha. For ground-based operations, approximately 54 percent of the residue in the harvest units was 90 m or less from the landing. Collection cost increases as the material is farther from the landing and ranged between about $17.6 per green tonne at distances of 15.2 m to $37 per green tonne at distances of 213 m from the landing. Depending on the distance from the landing to the bioenergy facility, it is possible to estimate how far from the landing into the forest to reach to economically collect the biomass.","2018","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2021-12-07 19:44:51","","191-198","","2","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000461045800013","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\D74M7YGI\Zamora-Cristales et al. - 2018 - Economic Estimation of the Available Biomass follo.pdf","","Management; Biomass; Journal Article; Oregon; Washington; Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigates how differing organic matter removal (OMR) intensities associated with timber harvest influence decadal-scale alterations in bacterial community composition and functional potential in the upper 1-m of the soil profile, 18 years post-harvest in a Pinus taeda L. forest of the southeastern USA. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used in conjunction with soil chemical analyses to evaluate (i) treatment-induced differences in bacterial community composition, and (ii) potential relationships between those differences and soil biogeochemical properties. Furthermore, functional potential was assessed by using amplicon data to make metagenomic predictions. Results indicate that increasing OMR intensity leads to altered bacterial community composition and the relative abundance of dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) annotated to Burkholderia and Aciditerrimonas; however, no significant differences in dominant phyla were observed. Genes involved in nitrification were significantly lower in the most intensively harvested treatment, most likely as a result of reduced substrate. Additionally, the relative abundance of genes associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification were highest in the most intensively harvested plots, indicating that the volatilization of N was a potential pathway of N loss in that treatment. Genes associated with glycosyltransferases were significantly reduced with increasing harvest intensity while polysaccharide lyases increased. Additionally, when overall differences in N-cycling genes were observed (0-100 cm), they generally occurred at soil depths below 30 cm, indicating the importance of examining deeper soil horizons when assessing the effect of forest disturbance on soil biogeochemical processes.","2018-04","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2021-12-07 19:43:11","","184-193","","","119","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000428496700021","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\E6G8QARQ\Mushinski et al. - 2018 - Bacterial metataxonomic profile and putative funct.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Processes; Soil; Harvest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a bottom-up, systematic, reproducible, and transparent literature assessment of the different options to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is currently missing. In part 1 of this three-part review on NETs, we assemble a comprehensive set of the relevant literature so far published, focusing on seven technologies: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering, ocean fertilisation, biochar, and soil carbon sequestration. In this part, part 2 of the review, we present estimates of costs, potentials, and side-effects for these technologies, and qualify them with the authors' assessment. Part 3 reviews the innovation and scaling challenges that must be addressed to realise NETs deployment as a viable climate mitigation strategy. Based on a systematic review of the literature, our best estimates for sustainable global NET potentials in 2050 are 0.5-3.6 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for afforestation and reforestation, 0.5-5GtCO(2) yr(-1) for BECCS, 0.5-2GtCO(2) yr(-1) for biochar, 2-4 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for enhanced weathering, 0.5-5 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for DACCS, and up to 5GtCO(2) yr(-1) for soil carbon sequestration.

While deforestation is a primary driver affecting forest C sources and sinks, the role of actively managed forests has gained appreciation and study by scientists and policymakers in recent decades. Implementation of active management regimes typically results in initial C losses, depending on the baseline used for comparison. There is strong evidence to support the long-term C benefits of actively managed forests compared to their unmanaged counterparts, however, when harvested biomass is efficiently used for wood products and to replace fossil fuels. Temporal, spatial, management, and land use factors, as well as the conceptual scope of assessments, all influence conclusions drawn regarding forest C budgets. Individual stand dynamics are sometimes used to assess C implications of management regimes, for example, even though forested landscapes buffer such dynamics and offer a more accurate, long-term picture. Managers must confront tradeoffs among C benefits and other environmental and economic values, but it is important to recognize that forested landscapes, even those with a high proportion of actively managed forest, most often contain substantial areas set aside and protected or managed with low intensity due to logistic, economic, and environmental considerations or certification and best management practice requirements. Emissions associated with management practices, harvesting, biomass transport, and product manufacturing should be accounted for in C budget assessments even though evidence suggests they comprise a small percentage of C sequestered in actively managed stands. Harvesting and other practices can reduce C stored in forest floors and soil but studies worldwide show responses too inconsistent to form the basis of default assumptions. Often overlooked are C benefits resulting from the role of active management in reducing susceptibility to wildfire, pests, and disease and in providing economic incentives that can deter forest conversion to urban development and other land uses that have substantial and permanent impacts on C storage and emissions.","2018-11-01","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-10 00:33:06","","350-354","","","427","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000440775600038","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8YL368U6\Vance - 2018 - Conclusions and caveats from studies of managed fo.pdf","","Management; Pools; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this prominence at regional scales, mature stands have rarely been the focus of research on forest carbon dynamics. We utilized an observational study design to (i) examine the medium-term impact of active management on carbon storage in live and dead vegetation in mature Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco)-dominated stands in western Oregon, and (ii) provide baseline estimates of total non-soil carbon storage during the mature phase of stand development for this forest type. Stands aged 106-193 years at the time of sampling were selected to represent a gradient in harvest intensity, from passive (reserve-based) management, to low-intensity (commercial thinning) and high-intensity (regeneration harvest with structural retention) active management. Active management treatments were implemented following the onset of maturity in stands with no prior management history, and sampling was conducted an average of 38 years and 22 years following treatment (mean for thinned and retention harvest conditions, respectively). Total non-soil carbon storage was significantly greater in stands managed using a reserve-based approach (mean of 575 Mg C ha(-1)) than those subject to retention harvest (mean 257 Mg C ha(-1)) 17 to -34 years previously, but was not different from stands managed over extended rotations with commercial thinning (mean 546 Mg C ha(-1)). A similar trend was evident for carbon storage in live overstory trees, which were also the dominant component of total non-soil carbon in all management conditions. Dead wood pools varied greatly among stands, but estimates did not indicate any systematic differences in carbon storage in dead wood between management conditions. Our results suggest that shifting from passive management to a high-intensity harvest regime in mature Douglas-fir stands will entail substantial reductions in carbon storage. By contrast, managing stands over extended rotations with light thinning may enable the provision of wood products while maintaining relatively high carbon storage in the forest ecosystem. In absolute terms, mean carbon storage across our full sample of unmanaged, low-intensity and high-intensity harvest conditions exceeded previously reported values from inventories of mature plots across a similarly broad range of site conditions, but remains below the potential upper bounds to carbon storage in Douglas-fir-dominated forests. However, total aboveground carbon stocks in excess of 700 Mg ha(-1) in individual mature stands in our dataset implies that, under certain conditions, forest biomass approaches its maximum by the close of the mature phase of stand development in Douglas-fir-dominated forests.","2019-01-15","2019-10-29 22:21:40","2020-10-14 15:49:53","","761-775","","","432","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000455068700074","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\27J85NQZ\Williams and Powers - 2019 - Carbon storage implications of active management i.pdf","","Management; Pools; Journal Article; Oregon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we examine the relative merits of afforestation, reforestation, management changes, and harvest residue bioenergy use in the Pacific Northwest. This region represents some of the highest carbon density forests in the world, which can store carbon in trees for 800 y or more. Oregon’s net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was equivalent to 72% of total emissions in 2011-2015. By 2100, simulations show increased net carbon uptake with little change in wildfires. Reforestation, afforestation, lengthened harvest cycles on private lands, and restricting harvest on public lands increase NECB 56% by 2100, with the latter two actions contributing the most. Resultant cobenefits included water availability and biodiversity, primarily from increased forest area, age, and species diversity. Converting 127,000 ha of irrigated grass crops to native forests could decrease irrigation demand by 233 billion m3 y-1. Utilizing harvest residues for bioenergy production instead of leaving them in forests to decompose increased emissions in the short-term (50 y), reducing mitigation effectiveness. Increasing forest carbon on public lands reduced emissions compared with storage in wood products because the residence time is more than twice that of wood products. Hence, temperate forests with high carbon densities and lower vulnerability to mortality have substantial potential for reducing forest sector emissions. Our analysis framework provides a template for assessments in other temperate regions.","2018-04-03","2020-08-05 16:41:10","2021-03-03 22:28:39","2020-08-05 16:41:10","3663-3668","","14","115","","Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\SWI68BZ5\Law et al. - 2018 - Land use strategies to mitigate climate change in .pdf","","Journal Article; Sequestration; Climate; Land use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Across western North American forests, fires are burning through landscapes with substantial tree mortality from insect outbreaks, often referred to as short-interval disturbances. These short-interval disturbances often result in beetle-killed snags (snags that subsequently burn) that are heavily charred, while their fire-killed (alive at time of fire) counterparts are lightly charred. We investigated whether the chemical signature of PyC on heavily charred beetle-killed snags differs from lightly charred fire-killed snags. Results We evaluated differences in PyC chemical concentrations and condensation on beetle-killed (n= 3) and fire-killed snags (n= 3) with the benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) molecular marker method. Beetle-killed snags exhibited over five times the grams of BPCA per kilogram of C, and over seven times the grams of BPCA per kilogram of material compared to fire-killed snags, indicating higher concentrations of PyC. Conclusion PyC concentrations were greater in samples from beetle-killed snags compared to fire-killed snags, pointing to an important compound effect from the interaction of beetle outbreak and wildfire in forest ecosystems. While this study was limited to a single fire event and sampling in individual trees, it provides insight into PyC on snags with different disturbance histories. The abundance of heavily charred snags from a fire burning through landscapes with high levels of existing mortality from drought, insect outbreaks, and previous wildfire events is becoming a more common legacy for contemporary western North American forests. Accordingly, the distinct wood-based PyC legacy could influence ecosystem functions: C sequestration, water purification, soil nutrient supply, and resources for wildlife.","2020-09-11","2020-10-01 03:35:51","2020-10-09 23:36:21","","","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\TKPBVRJP\Talucci et al. - 2020 - An added boost in pyrogenic carbon when wildfire b.pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; Mortality; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In frequent-fire forests, increasing drought frequency and severity are already causing widespread tree mortality events, which can exacerbate the carbon debt that has developed as a result of fire exclusion. Forest management techniques that reduce tree density and surface fuels decrease the risk of high-severity wildfire and may also limit drought-induced mortality by reducing competition. We used a long-term thinning and burning experiment in a mixed-conifer forest to investigate the effects of the 2012-2015 California drought on forest carbon dynamics in each treatment, including the carbon emissions from a second-entry prescribed fire that followed the drought. We assessed differences in carbon stability and tree survival across treatments, expecting that both carbon stability and survival probability would increase with increasing treatment intensity (decreasing basal area). Additionally, we analyzed the effects of drought- mortality on second-entry burn emissions and compared emissions for the first- and second-entry burns. We found a non-linear relationship between treatment intensity and carbon stability, which was in part driven by varying relationships between individual tree growing space and survival across treatments. Drought mortality increased dead tree and surface fuel carbon in all treatments, which contributed to higher second-entry burn emissions for two of the three burn treatments when compared to the first burn. Our findings suggest that restoration treatments will not serve as a panacea for ongoing climate change and that the carbon debt of these forests will become increasingly unstable as the carbon carrying capacity adjusts to severe drought events. Managing the carbon debt with prescribed fire will help reduce the risk of additional mortality from wildfire, but at an increasing carbon cost for forest management.","2020","2020-10-01 03:35:51","2020-10-14 22:19:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\SRM4IT7U\Goodwin et al. - Changing climate reallocates the carbon debt of fr.pdf","","Fire; Pools; Journal Article; Flux; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increased drainage is expected this century to meet the agricultural demands of a growing population. Wetland drainage can result in large soil C losses and the concentration of residual soil minerals such as iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al). In upland soils, reactive Fe and Al minerals can contribute to soil C accumulation through sorption to poorly crystalline minerals and coprecipitation of organo-metal complexes, as well as C loss via anaerobic respiration by Fe-reducing bacteria. The role of these minerals in soil C dynamics is often overlooked in managed wetland soils and may be particularly important in both drained and reflooded systems with elevated mineral concentrations. Reflooding drained soils have been proposed as a means to sequester C for climate change mitigation, yet little is known about how reactive Fe and Al minerals affect C cycling in restored wetlands. We explored the interactions among soil C and reactive Fe and Al minerals in drained and reflooded wetland soils. In reflooded soils, soil C was negatively associated with reactive Fe and reduced Fe(II), a proxy for anaerobic conditions (reactive Fe:R-2 = .54-.79; Fe(II):R-2 = .59-.89). In drained soils, organo-Al complexes were positively associated with soil C and Fe(II) (AlR2 = .91; Fe(II):R-2 = .54-.60). Soil moisture, organo-Al, and reactive Fe explained most of the variation observed in soil C concentrations across all sites (p < .01). Reactive Fe was negatively correlated to soil C concentrations across sites, suggesting these Fe pools may drive additional C losses in drained soils and limit C sequestration with reflooding. In contrast, reactive organo-Al in drained soils facilitates C storage via aggregation and/or formation of anaerobic (micro)sites that protect residual soil C from oxidation and may at least partially offset C losses.","2020","2020-10-01 03:35:51","2021-03-04 18:17:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\2RAYJC2J\Anthony and Silver - Mineralogical associations with soil carbon in man.pdf","","Wetlands; Management; Pools; Journal Article; Soil; Aquatic; California; Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our CMS employed a bottom-up, two-step modeling strategy beginning with a spatially and temporally biased sample: project datasets collected and contributed by US Forest Service (USFS) and other forestry stakeholders in 29 different project areas in the northwestern USA. Plot-level AGB estimates collected in the project areas served as the response variable for predicting AGB primarily from lidar metrics of canopy height and density (R-2= 0.8, RMSE = 115 Mg ha(-1), Bias = 2 Mg ha(-1)). This landscape model was used to map AGB estimates at 30 m resolution where lidar data were available. A stratified random sample of AGB pixels from these landscape-level AGB maps then served as training data for predicting AGB regionally from Landsat image time series variables processed through LandTrendr. In addition, climate metrics calculated from downscaled 30 year climate normals were considered as predictors in both models, as were topographic metrics calculated from elevation data; these environmental predictors allowed AGB estimation over the full range of observations with the regional model (R-2= 0.8, RMSE = 152 Mg ha(-1), Bias = 9 Mg ha(-1)), including higher AGB values (>400 Mg ha(-1)) where spectral predictors alone saturate. For both the landscape and regional models, the machine-learning algorithm Random Forests (RF) was consistently applied to select predictor variables and estimate AGB. We then calibrated the regional AGB maps using field plot data systematically collected without bias by the national Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program. We found both our project landscape and regional, annual AGB estimates to be unbiased with respect to FIA estimates (Biases of 1% and 0.7%, respectively) and conclude that they are well suited to inform forest management and planning decisions by our contributing stakeholders.

It provides a module that can work alongside the upland forest Generic Carbon Budget Model (GCBM) developed to eventually replace the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3) as the core model in Canada's National Forest Carbon Monitoring, Accounting and Reporting System. The CaMP (v2.0) provides a simple model foundation that can be applied nationally for 11 different peatland categories. It tracks the growth, turnover and decay in annual time steps of different vegetation components (foliage, branches, stems, and roots of trees, shrubs, sedges and mosses). It uses a Q(10) relationship to model peat C pool decomposition as a function of mean annual temperature, and models methane flux response to deviations in annual water table depth. The CaMP takes a simple approach to modeling hydrology for large spatial scales by using the nationally-available Canadian Fire Weather Index Drought Code to predict long-term and annual water table depth. The CaMP (v2.0) provides the framework needed to model disturbances but only includes wildfire in this version. Model behavior and sensitivity were assessed, and evaluated against observed flux data. Results suggest that the CaMP (v2.0) provides an appropriate structure for large spatial- and temporal-scale estimation of emissions, owing to the model behaving as expected relative to shifts in environmental variables, and to reasonably small mean observed to modeled residuals. Methane was overestimated by the model on average by 6 g C ha(-1) y(-1) (n = 53 years of data across 11 peatland sites), and by 8 g C ha(-1) y(-1) when weighted by site location (n = 12 sites, >= 3 years of data per site). The model overestimated net ecosystem exchange (NEE) by 20 g C ha(-1) y(-1) (n = 36 years of data across 12 peatland sites), and by 2 g C ha(-1) y(-1) when weighted by site location (n = 11 sites, >= 3 years of data per site), and results demonstrate that inter-site variation is greater than temporal variation across NEE measures. Several aspects were identified as requiring further work to increase explained variation in finer-scale emission estimates. Recommendations include further expanding the existing peatland databases to re-calibrate peat decomposition rates and better parameterize NPP rates by region for certain vegetation layers and peatland types, as well as developing a national annual-scale soil temperature model that could serve to replace the air temperature (Q(10)) decay relationship currently used in the CaMP (v2.0). Data gaps that were identified include the need for annualized methane flux datasets with appropriate annual-scale meta-data. Future work is required to include permafrost dynamics, as well as additional natural, and anthropogenic disturbances.","2020-09-01","2020-10-01 03:35:52","2021-12-07 16:13:25","","","","","431","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\FQPX5SDR\Bona et al. - 2020 - The Canadian model for peatlands (CaMP) A peatlan.pdf","","Wetlands; Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Soil; Aquatic; British Columbia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite its importance, the current understanding of the magnitude or even the direction of SOC change in agricultural landscapes is limited. While changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and climate are among the main drivers of changes in SOC, their relative importance for the spatiotemporal assessment of SOC is unclear. This study evaluated LULC and SOC dynamics using archived and recent soil samples, remote sensing, and digital soil mapping in the Lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada. We combined both pixel- and object-based analysis of Landsat satellite imagery to assess LULC changes from 1984 to 2018. We achieved an overall accuracy of 81% and kappa coefficient of 0.77 for LULC classification using a random forest model. For predicting SOC for the same time period, we applied soil and vegetation indices derived from Landsat images, topographic indices, historic soil survey variables, and climate data in a randomforest model. The SOC prediction of 2018 resulted in a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.67, concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.76, and normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of 0.12. For 1984, the SOC prediction accuracies were 0.46, 0.58, and 0.18 for R2, CCC, and nRMSE, respectively. We detected SOC loss in 61%, gain in 12%, while 27% remained unchanged across the study area. Although we detected large losses of SOC due to LULC change, the majority of the SOC losses across the landscape were attributed to areas that were remained in the same type of agricultural production since 1984. Climate variability did not, however, have a strong effect on SOC changes. These results can inform decision making in the study area to support sustainable LULC management for enhancing SOC sequestration.","2020-08-25","2020-10-01 03:35:52","2020-10-19 23:41:13","","","","","732","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\6KL7DNHR\Paul et al. - 2020 - Tracking changes in soil organic carbon across the.pdf","","Journal Article; Soil; Agriculture; British Columbia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research on soil and plant carbon responses to warming are often based on short-term (< 10 year) warming experiments. Furthermore, carbon budgets from boreal forests, which contain at least 10-20% of the global soil carbon pool, have shown mixed responses to warming. In this study, we measured carbon and nitrogen budgets (i.e., soil and understory vegetation carbon and nitrogen stocks) from a 13-year greenhouse warming experiment in an Alaskan boreal forest. Although there were no differences in total aboveground + belowground pools, the carbon in the moss biomass and in the soil organic layer significantly decreased with the warming treatment (- 88.3% and - 19.1%, respectively). Declines in moss biomass carbon may be a consequence of warming-associated drying, while shifts in the soil microbial community could be responsible for the decrease in carbon in the soil organic layer. Moreover, in response to warming, aboveground plant biomass carbon tended to increase while root biomass carbon tended to decrease, so carbon allocation may shift aboveground with warming. Overall these results suggest that permafrost-free boreal forests are susceptible to soil carbon loss with warming.","2020","2020-10-01 03:35:53","2020-10-14 22:19:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\BNH4SWC9\Alster et al. - 2020 - Carbon budgets for soil and plants respond to long.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Soil; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, little data exist for the carbon stocks of major tidal wetland types in the Pacific Northwest, United States. We quantified the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) in seagrass, emergent marshes, and forested tidal wetlands, occurring along increasing elevation and decreasing salinity gradients. The TECS included the total aboveground carbon stocks and the entire soil profile (to as deep as 3 m). TECS significantly increased along the elevation and salinity gradients: 217 +/- 60 Mg C/ha for seagrass (low elevation/high salinity), 417 +/- 70 Mg C/ha for low marsh, 551 +/- 47 Mg C/ha for high marsh, and 1,064 +/- 38 Mg C/ha for tidal forest (high elevation/low salinity). Soil carbon stocks accounted for >98% of TECS in the seagrass and marsh communities and 78% in the tidal forest. Soils in the 0-100 cm portion of the profile accounted for only 48%-53% of the TECS in seagrasses and marshes and 34% of the TECS in tidal forests. Thus, the commonly applied limit defining TECS to a 100 cm depth would greatly underestimate both carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from land-use conversion. The large carbon stocks coupled with other ecosystem services suggest value in the conservation and restoration of temperate zone tidal wetlands through climate change mitigation strategies. However, the findings suggest that long-term sea-level rise effects such as tidal inundation and increased porewater salinity will likely decrease ecosystem carbon stocks in the absence of upslope wetland migration buffer zones.","2020-10","2020-10-01 03:35:53","2020-10-07 17:38:11","","5679-5692","","10","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\K8SPX7IA\Kauffman et al. - 2020 - Total ecosystem carbon stocks at the marine-terres.pdf","","Wetlands; Pools; Journal Article; Aquatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the absence of large-scale observations, models used for global assessments tend to fall back on simplified assumptions of the turnover rates of biomass and soil carbon pools. In this study, the biomass carbon turnover times calculated by an ensemble of contemporary terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) are analysed to assess their current capability to accurately estimate biomass carbon turnover times in forests and how these times are anticipated to change in the future. Modelled baseline 1985-2014 global average forest biomass turnover times vary from 12.2 to 23.5 years between TBMs. TBM differences in phenological processes, which control allocation to, and turnover rate of, leaves and fine roots, are as important as tree mortality with regard to explaining the variation in total turnover among TBMs. The different governing mechanisms exhibited by each TBM result in a wide range of plausible turnover time projections for the end of the century. Based on these simulations, it is not possible to draw robust conclusions regarding likely future changes in turnover time, and thus biomass change, for different regions. Both spatial and temporal uncertainty in turnover time are strongly linked to model assumptions concerning plant functional type distributions and their controls. Thirteen model-based hypotheses of controls on turnover time are identified, along with recommendations for pragmatic steps to test them using existing and novel observations.

Many dry temperate forests in the western United States are adapted to a regime of frequent, low-to-moderate severity fire. The disruption of this disturbance regime over the last century has shifted forest conditions, making them more susceptible to high-severity fire. Fuel treatments have been shown to effectively reduce wildfire hazard, often with co-benefits to ecological values. However, the effects of fuel treatments on forest carbon are complex, often characterized by direct costs (e.g., carbon emissions from prescribed fire) and wildfire-contingent benefits (increased resistance of live tree carbon to wildfire). In this study, we employ risk-sensitive carbon accounting and empirical data from a replicated field experiment to evaluate the stand-scale carbon effects of four management regimes over a 14-yr period in a historically frequent-fire adapted forest. All three active treatment regimes immediately increased stable live tree carbon stocks over no-treatment controls. In most contexts examined, mechanical-only or no-treatment controls will maximize expected total carbon stocks when incorporating wildfire risk and the carbon stability of live biomass, dead biomass, and offsite forest products, although we acknowledge our wildfire modeling may underestimate C losses, particularly in the control stands. Undoubtedly, many other ecosystem and social values besides carbon will be important factors that influence fuel and restoration treatments.","2020-08","2020-10-01 03:35:53","2020-10-06 22:21:39","","","","8","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\2CQGAS4N\Foster et al. - 2020 - Potential wildfire and carbon stability in frequen.pdf","","Fire; Pools; Journal Article; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extreme rates of soil C accumulation are widely assumed to reflect efficient C storage. Yet the fraction of wetland C lost via hydrologic export has not been directly quantified, since comprehensive budgets including direct estimates of lateral C loss are lacking. We present a complete net ecosystem C budget (NECB), demonstrating that lateral losses of C are a major component of the NECB for the largest stable brackish tidal marsh on the U.S. Pacific coast. Mean annual net ecosystem exchange of CO(2)with the atmosphere (NEE = -185 g C m(2)year(-1), negative NEE denoting ecosystem uptake) was compared to long-term soil C burial (87-110 g C m(2)year(-1)), suggesting only 47-59% of fixed atmospheric C accumulates in soils. Consistently, direct monitoring in 2017-2018 showed NEE of -255 g C m(-2) year(-1), and hydrologic export of 105 g C m(-2) year(-1)(59% of NEE remaining on site). Despite their high C sequestration capacity, lateral losses from coastal wetlands are typically a larger fraction of the NECB when compared to other terrestrial ecosystems. Loss of inorganic C (the least measured NECB term) was 91% of hydrologic export and may be the most important term limiting C sequestration. The high productivity of coastal wetlands thus serves a dual function of C burial and estuarine export, and the multiple fates of fixed C must be considered when evaluating wetland capacity for C sequestration.","2020-08","2020-10-01 03:35:54","2020-10-05 16:45:19","","","","8","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\T87L46I9\Bogard et al. - 2020 - Hydrologic Export Is a Major Component of Coastal .pdf","","Wetlands; Journal Article; Flux; Aquatic; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasing temperatures reduced the carbon proportion of wood in some cases.Background and Objectives: Our goal was to estimate the structural carbon content of wood within hybrid white spruce (Picea glauca(Moench) xengelmannii(Parry) grown in British Columbia, Canada, and compare the percent carbon content to wood properties and climate conditions of the region. Specific objectives included: (i) the determination of average incremental percent carbon, ring widths (RW), earlywood (EW) and latewood (LW) widths, cell wall thickness, and density over time; (ii) the determination of differences between percent carbon in individual forest stands and between regions; and (iii) the evaluation of the relationships between percent carbon and climate variation over time.Methods:Trees were sampled from twelve sites in northern British Columbia. Wood cores were analyzed with standard dendrochronology techniques and SilviScan analysis. Percent structural carbon was determined using acetone extraction and elemental analysis for 5 year increments. Individual chronologies of wood properties and percent carbon, and chronologies grouped by region were compared by difference of means. Temperature and precipitation values from the regions were compared to the carbon chronologies using correlation, regression, and visual interpretation.Results:Significant differences were found between the percent structural carbon of wood in individual natural and planted stands; none in regional aggregates. Some significant relationships were found between percent carbon, RW, EW, LW, and the cell wall thickness and density values. Percent carbon accumulation in planted stands and natural stands was found in some cases to correlate with increasing temperatures. Natural stand percent carbon values truncated to the last 30 years of growth was shown as more sensitive to climate variation compared to the entire time series.Conclusions: Differences between the stands in terms of structural carbon proportion vary by site-specific climate characteristics in areas of central interior British Columbia. Wood properties can be good indicators of variation in sequestered carbon in some stands. Carbon accumulation was reduced with increasing temperatures; however, warmer late-season conditions appear to enhance growth and carbon accumulation.","2020-08","2020-10-01 03:35:54","2020-10-07 16:55:28","","","","8","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8LIG3UE9\Ivanusic et al. - 2020 - Structural Carbon Allocation and Wood Growth Refle.pdf","","Journal Article; Growth; British Columbia; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we examine the potential of riparian zone restoration to enhance carbon sequestration. We measured soil and woody biomass carbon stocks, as well as soil carbon properties, in a long-term chronosequence of 42 streambank revegetation projects in northern California rangelands, varying in restoration age from 1 to 45 years old. Results Where revegetation was successful, we found that soil carbon measured to 50 cm depth increased at a rate of 0.87 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1)on the floodplain and 1.12 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1)on the upper bank landform. Restored sites also exhibited trends toward increased soil carbon permanence, including an increased C:N ratio and lower fulvic acid: humic acid ratio. Tree and shrub carbon in restored sites was modeled to achieve a 50-year maximum of 187.5 Mg C ha(-1)in the channel, 279.3 Mg ha(-1)in the floodplain, and 238.66 Mg ha(-1)on the upper bank. After 20 years of restoration, the value of this carbon at current per-ton C prices would amount to $US 15,000 per km of restored stream. Conclusion We conclude that revegetating rangeland streambanks for erosion control has a substantial additional benefit of mitigating global climate change, and should be considered in carbon accounting and any associated financial compensation mechanisms.","2020-07-31","2020-10-01 03:35:55","2021-12-07 19:45:09","","","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\YPMDLSPN\Matzek et al. - 2020 - Increases in soil and woody biomass carbon stocks .pdf","","Management; Biomass; Journal Article; Soil; California; Silviculture; Live vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, reintroducing fire causes tree mortality that can have unintended ecological outcomes related to woody biomass, with potential impacts to fuel accumulation, carbon sequestration, subsequent fire severity, and forest management. In this study, we examine the interplay between fire and carbon dynamics by asking how reintroduced fire impacts fuel accumulation, carbon sequestration, and subsequent fire severity potential. Beginning pre-fire, and continuing 6 years post-fire, we tracked all live, dead, and fallen trees >= 1 cm in diameter and mapped all pieces of deadwood (downed woody debris) originating from tree boles >= 10 cm diameter and >= 1 m in length in 25.6 ha of anAbies concolor/Pinus lambertianaforest in the central Sierra Nevada, California, USA. We also tracked surface fuels along 2240 m of planar transects pre-fire, immediately post-fire, and 6 years post-fire. Six years after moderate-severity fire, deadwood >= 10 cm diameter was 73 Mg ha(-1), comprised of 32 Mg ha(-1)that persisted through fire and 41 Mg ha(-1)of newly fallen wood (compared to 72 Mg ha(-1)pre-fire). Woody surface fuel loading was spatially heterogeneous, with mass varying almost four orders of magnitude at the scale of 20 m x 20 m quadrats (minimum, 0.1 Mg ha(-1); mean, 73 Mg ha(-1); maximum, 497 Mg ha(-1)). Wood from large-diameter trees (>= 60 cm diameter) comprised 57% of surface fuel in 2019, but was 75% of snag biomass, indicating high contributions to current and future fuel loading. Reintroduction of fire does not consume all large-diameter fuel and generates high levels of surface fuels >= 10 cm diameter within 6 years. Repeated fires are needed to reduce surface fuel loading.","2020-07-27","2020-10-01 03:35:55","2020-10-07 21:59:44","","","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\V4KDD2SL\Lutz et al. - 2020 - Large-diameter trees dominate snag and surface bio.pdf","","Fire; Biomass; Journal Article; California; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NEE is the difference between the total CO2 release due to all respiration processes (RECO), and the gross carbon uptake by photosynthesis (GPP). These two gross CO2 fluxes are derived from EC measurements by applying partitioning methods that rely on physiologically based functional relationships with a limited number of environmental drivers. However, the partitioning methods applied in the global FLUXNET network of EC observations do not account for the multiple co-acting factors that modulate GPP and RECO flux dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we developed a hybrid data-driven approach based on combined neural networks (NNC-part). NNIC-part part incorporates process knowledge by introducing a photosynthetic response based on the light-use efficiency (LUE) concept, and uses a comprehensive dataset of soil and micrometeorological variables as fluxes drivers. We applied the method to 36 sites from the FLUXNET2015 dataset and found a high consistency in the results with those derived from other standard partitioning methods for both GPP (R-2 > .94) and RECO (R-2 > .8). High consistency was also found for (a) the diurnal and seasonal patterns of fluxes and (b) the ecosystem functional responses. NNC-part performed more realistic than the traditional methods for predicting additional patterns of gross CO2 fluxes, such as: (a) the GPP response to VPD, (b) direct effects of air temperature on GPP dynamics, (c) hysteresis in the diel cycle of gross CO2 fluxes, (d) the sensitivity of LUE to the diffuse to direct radiation ratio, and (e) the post rain respiration pulse after a long dry period. In conclusion, NNC-part is a valid data-driven approach to provide GPP and RECO estimates and complementary to the existing partitioning methods.","2020-09","2020-10-01 03:35:55","2020-10-10 00:09:39","","5235-5253","","9","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\N3HT7JU8\Tramontana et al. - 2020 - Partitioning net carbon dioxide fluxes into photos.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measured annual production of plant components (foliage, wood, fine roots) and mycorrhizal fungi across temperate forest stands varying in species composition. Production of mycorrhizal fungi was estimated using both mass balance and isotopic techniques. Total plant production varied from about 600 g C m(-2) y(-1) in nearly pure deciduous broadleaf stands down to about 300 g C m(-2) y(-1) in conifer-dominated stands. In contrast, the production of mycorrhizal fungi was highest in conifer-dominated stands, varying from less than 25 g C m(-2) y(-1) in deciduous broadleaf stands to more than 175 g C m(-2) y(-1) in nearly pure conifer stands. Isotopic data indicated that both tree species composition and ecosystem nitrogen (N) availability influenced rates of fungal production. The large investment in mycorrhizal fungi in low-N, conifer-dominated stands demonstrated that a full accounting of ecosystem carbon fluxes to plant and fungal components may help resolve current discrepancies observed in broadscale forest carbon budgets, especially across forest types.","2020-06","2020-10-01 03:35:56","2020-10-07 23:45:55","","715-729","","4","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\JDLN4H7X\Ouimette et al. - 2020 - Accounting for Carbon Flux to Mycorrhizal Fungi Ma.pdf","","Roots; Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Radiocarbon (Delta C-14) measurements separated fungi into heartwood colonizers (Fomitopsis and Hericium, similar to 30+-year-old carbon) and sapwood colonizers (Mycena, Hypholoma, and Trametes, 1-12-year-old carbon). Decay modes influenced delta C-13, with Hericium, a selective white-rot fungus, higher in delta C-13 than nonselective white-rot fungi because Hericium preferentially assimilated C-13-enriched hemicellulose rather than cellulose. Fungal delta N-15 was lower in heartwood colonizers than in sapwood colonizers, presumably reflecting greater N turnover and N-15 enrichment in sapwood than in heartwood. Sporocarp delta N-15 correlated with sporocarp %N and with the relative proportion of protein in N-containing pyrolysis products because fungal protein was 4-5 parts per thousand higher in delta N-15 (and 3-4%0 higher in delta C-13) than non-protein.

Field trials were established in a randomized complete block design by Stimson Lumber Company (Gaston, Oregon), to test the economic viability of N fertilization on their ownership and to better understand Douglas-fir growth responses. The 23 stands comprising the trials were Douglas-fir dominated, had a total age of 16-24 years, had been precommercially thinned, and had a density of 386-1021 trees ha(-1). Fertilizer was applied aerially at a rate of 224 kg N ha(-1)as urea during the 2009-2010 dormant season. In the dormant season of 2016-2017, seven growing seasons following application, 40 trees were felled and measured with the objective of assessing crown attributes and aboveground allometrics. Branch-level foliage mass equations were developed from 267 subsampled branches and were applied to the 40 felled sample trees on which the basal diameter and height of all live branches were measured, allowing estimation of both the total amount of foliage and its vertical distribution. A right-truncated Weibull distribution was fitted to data, with the truncation point specified as the base of live tree crown. The resulting tree-level parameter estimates were modeled as functions of tree-level variables. Stand-level factors not explicitly measured were captured through the use of linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models with random stand effects. Fertilization resulted in more total crown foliage mass in the middle crown-third and caused a downward shift in the vertical distribution of foliage, with implications for feedback responses in crown development and photosynthetic capacity. Defining the morphological responses of Douglas-fir crowns to nitrogen fertilization provides a framework for studying influences on stand dynamics and should ultimately facilitate improved site-specific predictions of stem-volume growth.","2020-05","2020-10-01 03:35:57","2021-12-07 19:45:09","","","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\GSZPIK49\Putney and Maguire - 2020 - Shifts in Foliage Biomass and Its Vertical Distrib.pdf","","Management; Biomass; Journal Article; Oregon; Silviculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To study relationships between coarse roots and tree and stand variables, we destructively sampled twelve tanoak root systems in Humboldt County, California. To estimate belowground biomass, we summed measured biomass of the root ball and a subsample of lateral roots along with predicted biomass of unmeasured coarse roots. Tree size was the best linear predictor of belowground biomass and carbon, indicating that a 25-cm diameter tanoak, for example, stored 70 kg of biomass and 34 kg of carbon in its root system. Stand density was also influential: a doubling of stand density index reduced belowground carbon by 22% for the average tanoak. The mean root-toshoot ratio of 0.35 varied between 0.11 and 0.65, with larger tanoak at high stand densities allocating proportionally less biomass belowground than small open-grown tanoak. The findings highlight the importance of accounting for stand density effects, otherwise belowground carbon will be under predicted in low-density stands managed for tree health, vigor, and resistance to drought and wildfire, or overestimated in forests managed at high densities for high carbon sequestration.","2020-05","2020-10-01 03:35:57","2021-12-07 22:25:24","","50-60","","1","96","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\7M7LTADU\Namm and Berrill - 2020 - How do tree- and stand-level factors influence bel.pdf","","Biomass; Roots; Pools; Journal Article; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Usually harvesting is done during the peak growing season to maximize the amount of nutrients removed from the system. This, however, can create huge methane fluxes that escape from plant tissues to the atmosphere. We used manual chambers and eddy covariance measurements to analyze the increase in methane emissions due to the harvesting of two common wetland species, Typha spp. and Schoenoplectus spp., in two climatically different constructed wetlands in Estonia and California. In addition, we determined the biomass nutrient and carbon concentrations from harvested biomass. We found that harvesting during the summer season, e.g. June and August, resulted in a significant release of methane at both sites. At the California site, baseline median methane emissions were 217.6 nmol m(-2)s(-1) , and harvesting resulted in increases to 395.4 nmol m(-2)s(-1) that decreased to baseline emission within three days. Footprint modeling demonstrated that the emission increases measured by eddy covariance were dominated by contributions from the cut area to the total footprint signal. At the Estonian site, harvesting resulted in methane increases of 15.9 nmol m(-2)s(-1) to 110.4 nmol m(-2)s(-1) in August. However, in September and October the emission was significantly lower. Plant biomass analyses showed clear temporal dynamics in terms of nutrient concentration, being highest in summer and lowest in winter. Our experiments indicate that the optimal lime for aboveground biomass harvesting is at the end of the growing season before nutrient translocation to belowground plant structures begins coinciding with lowest methane emissions. Therefore, strategic planning of the harvest timing may help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from managed wetlands and thus improve their multi-faceted ecological benefit. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Aboveground litter quantity and quality was manipulated for 20 years in an old-growth Douglas fir forest under six treatments to study relationships among litter inputs, DOC production and flux, and soil C dynamics. DOC concentrations were measured at two depths using tension lysimeters, and a hydrologic model was created to quantify water and DOC flux through the soil profile. DOC concentrations ranged from 3.0-8.0 and 1.5-2.5 mg C/L among treatments at 30 and 100 cm below the soil surface, respectively. Aboveground detrital inputs did not have a consistent positive effect on soil solution DOC; the addition of coarse woody debris increased soil solution DOC by 58% 30 cm belowground, while doubling the mass of aboveground leaf litter decreased DOC concentrations by 30%. We suggest that high-quality leaf litter accelerated microbial processing, resulting in a “priming” effect that led to the lower concentrations. Annual DOC flux into groundwater was small (2.7-3.7 g C/m(2)/year) and accounts for < 0.1% of estimated litter C at the site. Therefore, direct DOC loss from surface litter to groundwater is relatively negligible to the soil C budget. However, DOC flux into the soil surface was much greater (73-210 g C/m(2)/year), equivalent to 1.4-2.4% of aboveground litter C. Therefore, DOC transport is an important source of C to shallow soil horizons.","2020-05","2020-10-01 03:35:58","2021-12-07 19:03:55","","75-86","","1","149","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\IMPVKWU4\Evans et al. - 2020 - Dissolved organic carbon production and flux under.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Flux; Soil; Aquatic; DOC; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Frequent fires can change soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage by altering the quantity and chemistry of plant inputs through changes in plant biomass and composition as well as altering decomposition of soil organic matter. How decomposition rates change with shifting inputs remains uncertain because most studies focus on the effects of single fires, where transient responses may not reflect responses to decadal changes in burning frequencies. Here, we sampled seven sites exposed to different fire frequencies. In four of the sites, we intensively sampled both soils and plant communities across four ecosystems in North America and Africa spanning tropical savanna, temperate coniferous savanna, temperate broadleaf savanna, and temperate coniferous forest ecosystems. Each site contained multiple plots burned frequently for 33-61 years and nearby plots that had remained unburned over the same period replicated at the landscape scale. Across all sites, repeatedly burned plots had 25-185% lower bulk soil C and N concentrations but also 2-10-fold lower potential decomposition of organic matter compared to unburned sites. Soil C and N concentrations and extracellular enzyme activities declined with frequent fire because fire reduced both plant biomass inputs into soils and dampened the localized enrichment effect of tree canopies. Examination of soil extracellular enzyme activities revealed that fire decreased the potential turnover of organic matter in the forms of cellulose, starch, and chitin (P < 0.0001) but not polyphenol and lignin (P = 0.09), suggesting a shift in soil C and N cycling. Inclusion of delta C-13 data from three additional savanna sites (19-60 years of altered fire frequencies) showed that soil C losses were largest in sites where estimated tree inputs into soils declined the most (r(2) = 0.91, P < 0.01). In conclusion, repeated burning reduced C and N storage, consistent with previous studies, but fire also reduced potential decomposition, likely contributing to slower C and N cycling. Trees were important in shaping soil C and N responses across sites, but the magnitude of tree effects differed and depended on how tree biomass inputs into soil responded to fire.","2020","2020-10-01 03:35:58","2021-12-07 19:30:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\U48YB3GV\Pellegrini et al. - Repeated fire shifts carbon and nitrogen cycling b.pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; Processes; Soil; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Soil resource stoichiometry (C : N: P) may provide an effective measure of site nutrient status and help refine species-dependent patterns in forest productivity across edaphic gradients. We determined mineral soil and forest floor nutrient concentrations across very wet (perhumid) rainforest sites of southwestern Vancouver Island (Canada) and employed soil element ratios as covariates in a long-term planting density trial to test their utility in defining basal area growth response of four conifer species. There were strong positive correlations in mineral soil C, N, and organic P (P-o) concentrations and close alignment in C : N and C : P-o both among and between substrates. Stand basal area after 5 decades was best reflected by mineral soil and forest floor C : N, but in either case included a significant species-soil interaction. The conifers with ectomycorrhizal fungi had diverging growth responses displaying either competitive (Picea sitchensis) or stress-tolerant (Tsuga heterophylla, Pseudotsuga menziesii) attributes, in contrast to a more generalist response by an arbuscular mycorrhizal tree (Thuja plicata). Despite the consistent patterns in organic matter quality, we found no evidence for increased foliar P concentrations with declining element ratios (C : P-o or C: P-total) as we did for N. The often high C: P-o ratios (as much as 3000) of these soils may reflect a stronger immobilization sink for P than N, which, along with ongoing sorption of PO4, could limit the utility of C : P-o or N: P-o to adequately reflect P supply. The dynamics and availability of soil P to trees, particularly as P-o, deserves greater attention, as many perhumid rainforests were co-limited by N and P, or, in some stands, possibly P alone.","2020-03-06","2020-10-01 03:35:58","2020-10-07 18:12:09","","1247-1260","","5","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\7CKTE44E\Kranabetter et al. - 2020 - Contrasting conifer species productivity in relati.pdf","","Journal Article; Soil; Growth; British Columbia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two complementary studies were designed to test the hypotheses (H) that large-scale PCT and PCT with repeated fertilization of young (13-17 years old) lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) stands, at 25 years after the onset of treatments, would enhance (H-1) productivity and structural features (diameter and height growth, crown volume and dimensions) of crop trees; (H-2) merchantable volume of crop trees, (H-3) abundance of understory conifer, herb and shrub layers, and (H-4) carbon storage (sequestration) of all layers. Results are from two studies in south-central British Columbia, Canada. The PCT study had three densities: 500, 1000, and 2000 stems/ha, an unthinned, and old-growth stand replicated at three areas. The PCT-FERT study had four densities: 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 stems/ha with and without a repeated fertilization treatment, and an unthinned-unfertilized stand, replicated at two areas. Heavily thinned (<= 1000 stems/ha) and fertilized stands generally had larger mean diameters and crown dimensions than lightly thinned or unfertilized stands, whereas mean heights of crop trees remained relatively unaffected, and hence partial support for H-1. Despite differences in stand density (4- and 8-fold) of original crop trees, ingress of intermediate crop trees over the 25 years changed density dramatically. There was no support for H-2, as mean merchantable volume of total crop trees was similar across stand densities owing to ingress, and was also similar in fertilized and unfertilized stands. In stands thinned to <= 500 trees/ha, there is an anticipated increase in crop tree density of 2.2 to 4.3 times over 25 years compared with the original post-thinning densities. Mean abundance of understory conifers was generally similar among stands owing to successional development towards canopy closure, whereas herbs and shrubs persisted only in canopy gaps in heavily thinned stands, thereby providing no support for H-3. Mean carbon storage was similar across densities in both studies with ingress contributing a considerable amount to carbon sequestration at the lower densities. Fertilization increased (1.4 times) mean carbon storage significantly among total crop trees, total conifers, and the grand total of all layers, thereby providing partial support for H-4. Thus, much of the potential above-ground carbon storage lost by thinning was restored in the heavily thinned stands at 25 years post-treatment.","2020-03","2020-10-01 03:35:59","2021-12-07 19:45:09","","","","3","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QBX8XN3U\Sullivan et al. - 2020 - Twenty-Five Years after Stand Thinning and Repeate.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Sequestration; Growth; Silviculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known, however, about the assimilation of old C by aquatic food webs in Arctic watersheds. Here, we used C isotopes (delta C-13, Delta C-14) to quantify C assimilation by biota across 12 streams in arctic Alaska. Streams spanned watersheds with varying permafrost hydrology, from ice-poor bedrock to ice-rich loess (that is, yedoma). We measured isotopic content of (1) C sources including dissolved organic C (DOC), dissolved inorganic C (DIC), and soil C, and (2) stream biota, including benthic biofilm and macroinvertebrates, and resident fish species (Arctic Grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma)). Findings document the assimilation of old C by stream biota, with depleted Delta C-14 values observed at multiple trophic levels, including benthic biofilm (C-14 ages = 5255 to 265 years before present (y BP)), macroinvertebrates (4490 y BP to modern), and fish (3195 y BP to modern). Mixing model results indicate that DOC and DIC contribute to benthic biofilm composition, with relative contributions differing across streams draining ice-poor and ice-rich terrain. DOC originates primarily from old terrestrial C sources, including deep peat horizons (39-47%; 530 y BP) and near-surface permafrost (12-19%; 5490 y BP). DOC also accounts for approximately half of fish isotopic composition. Analyses suggest that as the contribution of old C to fish increases, fish growth and nutritional status decline. We anticipate increases in old DOC delivery to streams under projected warming, which may further alter food web function in Arctic watersheds.","2020-03","2020-10-01 03:35:59","2020-10-07 23:31:37","","435-453","","2","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ZDPQTCPN\O'Donnell et al. - 2020 - Permafrost Hydrology Drives the Assimilation of Ol.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Soil; Aquatic; Perfmafrost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the control of this species is a common ecological restoration practice. However, western juniper control may also affect the carbon sequestration capacity for an area, although this effect is not well understood. Our study site was a paired watershed in central Oregon where western juniper trees were cut in one watershed (treated, 116 ha) and were left intact in another (untreated, 96 ha). Thirteen years after control, we quantified aboveground carbon stocks for western juniper trees, shrubs, grasses, and litter in both the treated and untreated watersheds. We also quantified belowground carbon stocks (roots and soil) in both watersheds at two soil depths (0-25 cm and 25-50 cm). Aboveground carbon stocks were 5.8 times greater in the untreated than in the treated watershed. On the other hand, root carbon stocks were 2.6 times greater in the treated than in the untreated watershed. Soil carbon stocks at both 0-25 cm and 25-50 cm depth were not affected by juniper control. Overall, total ecosystem carbon stocks (average 137.6 Mg C ha(-1)) were not different between watersheds. Most carbon resided belowground (soil 0-50 cm and roots); 84% and 97% of the total ecosystem carbon, respectively, was found in the untreated and treated watershed. Juniper control represents benefits such as habitat restoration for native wildlife, increased forage for livestock, and restoration of hydrological functions. Our study provides basis to suggest that the benefits of juniper control can be attained without substantially affecting the potential for ecosystem carbon sequestration.","2020-03-01","2020-10-01 03:35:59","2020-10-01 16:04:19","","","","","290","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\C5HRMLWT\Abdallah et al. - 2020 - Ecosystem carbon in relation to woody plant encroa.pdf","","Management; Pools; Journal Article; Soil; Oregon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, while cities have been shown to store substantial amounts of carbon in soils and vegetation, we have little information from long-term studies about how contemporary carbon storage in urban areas compares to carbon storage in the natural ecosystems that characterized these landscapes prior to urbanization. We used historical archival sources and land-cover data to quantify and map historical tree carbon storage in the now-urban Santa Clara Valley, California, USA prior to substantial Euro-American modification (ca. 1850) and to analyze change in the amount and distribution of carbon storage over the past ca. 160 years. We estimate that total tree carbon storage in the study area was similar to 784,000 to 2.2 million Mg (13.6-38.1 Mg C/ha) when the region was characterized by oak savanna and woodland habitats, compared to similar to 895,000 Mg C (15.5 Mg C/ha) today. This represents a non-significant gain of 14% to a significant loss of 60% depending on scenario. We also demonstrate changes in the spatial distribution of carbon on the landscape, as losses in carbon storage in areas of former oak woodland were partially offset by gains in carbon storage in historical habitat types that historically had few or no trees. This challenges the hypothesis that aboveground carbon storage increases with urbanization in Mediterranean-climate ecosystems due to irrigation and tree planting. Our study demonstrates the utility of using pre-1900s historical sources to reconstruct changes in ecosystem services such as carbon storage over century time scales.","2020-03","2020-10-01 03:35:59","2020-10-01 23:03:06","","","","","195","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ID5UXCCZ\Beller et al. - 2020 - From savanna to suburb Effects of 160 years of la.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Urban forest; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we determine if these forests also have maximum productivity. Intensive measurements of 114 trees 18-116 m tall and 115-2340 yr old were used to improve allometric equations for Sequoia. Applying the best available allometry to all vegetation in eleven 1-ha plots re-measured at 5-yr intervals yielded accurate estimates of aboveground biomass and growth increments. Plots initially held 1594-4341 Mg ha(-1) of biomass (805-2201 Mg C ha(-1)), which increased by 14.7-40.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), including input of dead biomass from outside plots. Live biomass increments ranged from 1.2 to 19.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) and were dominated by heartwood accumulation in Sequoia (up to 15.6 Mg ha(-1 )yr(-1)). Exceptional old-growth Sequoia forests thus produce more aboveground biomass annually-and sequester more carbon in decay-resistant heartwood-than forests dominated by any other species. However, live biomass increments are considerably higher in an exceptional second-growth Sequoia forest and a fully stocked Sequoia plantation. Old-growth forest productivity falls short of the maximum, because growth efficiency declines with increasing tree size such that much of an old forest's photosynthetic capacity resides in crowns of very large trees producing considerably less aboveground biomass per unit leaf mass than small trees. Decreasing Sequoia growth efficiency is strongly related to heartwood proportions of biomass increments, which increase as trees enlarge with age. With increasing tree size, more productivity may also be directed to roots supporting clonal regeneration, explaining why small Sequoia produce several times more aboveground biomass per unit leaf mass than co-occurring species. Since decay-resistant heartwood promotes tree longevity and supports biodiversity, silviculture that includes indefinite retention of Sequoia trees can sustain high productivity while also improving both the carbon sequestration potential and conservation value of managed forests.","2020-02-15","2020-10-01 03:35:59","2020-10-09 17:55:12","","","","","458","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8SK62TRI\Sillett et al. - 2020 - Aboveground biomass dynamics and growth efficiency.pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; California; Growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although soil erosion that removes land organic carbon has increased substantially since the onset of agriculture, it is rarely included in the current generation of climate models. Using an Earth system model (ESM) with soil erosion represented, we estimated that on average soil erosion displaces 5% of newly fixed land organic carbon downslope annually in the continental United States. In the lower Mississippi river basin and the Cascades, the fraction can be as large as 40%. About 12% of the eroded organic carbon is eventually exported to inland waters, which is equal to 14% of the simulated net carbon gain by terrestrial ecosystems. By comparing the eroded organic carbon export to rivers with the particulate organic carbon export to oceans, we demonstrated that a large fraction of the carbon export to rivers could have been mineralized in inland waters. Importantly, with a direct comparison of eroded and exported soil organic carbon and land net carbon uptake, we found that ESMs that ignore soil erosion likely offset the erosional carbon loss by increasing heterotrophic respiration implicitly. But as soil erosion and heterotrophic respiration respond differently to a warming climate, this unrealistic compensation would lead to biased predictions of future land carbon sink.","2020-04","2020-10-01 03:36:00","2021-12-07 17:01:17","","2642-2655","","4","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\NYPTD8S4\Tan et al. - 2020 - A substantial role of soil erosion in the land car.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Flux; Soil; Aquatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluate soil carbon stocks and turnover rates, and the relationship between soil carbon loss with soil temperature and moisture, from an ensemble of eleven global land surface models. We focus on the region of NASA's Arctic-Boreal vulnerability experiment (ABoVE) in North America to inform data collection and model development efforts. Models exhibit an order of magnitude difference in estimates of current total soil carbon stocks, generally under- or overestimating the size of current soil carbon stocks by greater than 50 PgC. We find that a model's soil carbon stock at steady-state in 1901 is the prime driver of its soil carbon stock a hundred years later-overwhelming the effect of environmental forcing factors like climate. The greatest divergence between modeled and observed soil carbon stocks is in regions dominated by peat and permafrost soils, suggesting that models are failing to capture the frozen soil carbon dynamics of permafrost regions. Using a set of functional benchmarks to test the simulated relationship of soil respiration to both soil temperature and moisture, we find that although models capture the observed shape of the soil moisture response of respiration, almost half of the models examined show temperature sensitivities, or Q10 values, that are half of observed. Significantly, models that perform better against observational constraints of respiration or carbon stock size do not necessarily perform well in terms of their functional response to key climatic factors like changing temperature. This suggests that models may be arriving at the right result, but for the wrong reason. The results of this work can help to bridge the gap between data and models by both pointing to the need to constrain initial carbon pool sizes, as well as highlighting the importance of incorporating functional benchmarks into ongoing, mechanistic modeling activities such as those included in ABoVE.","2020-02","2020-10-01 03:36:01","2020-10-07 16:27:08","","","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ZIQT5NNK\Huntzinger et al. - 2020 - Evaluation of simulated soil carbon dynamics in Ar.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Flux; Soil; Boreal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined soil total C and total delta C-13, organic C and organic delta C-13, total N, and delta N-15 in residential yards and corresponding reference ecosystems in six cities across the United States that span major climates and ecological biomes (Baltimore, Maryland; Boston, Massachusetts; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota; and Phoenix, Arizona). Across the cities, we found soil C and N concentrations and soil delta N-15 were less variable in residential yards compared to reference sites supporting the hypothesis that soil C, N, and delta N-15 converge across these cities. Increases in organic soil C, soil N, and soil delta N-15 across urban, suburban, and rural residential yards in several cities supported the hypothesis that soils responded similarly to altered resource inputs across cities, contributing to convergence of soil C and N in yards compared to natural systems. Soil C and N dynamics in residential yards showed evidence of increasing C and N inputs to urban soils or dampened decomposition rates over time that are influenced by climate and/or housing age across the cities. In the warmest cities (Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix), greater organic soil C and higher soil delta C-13 in yards compared to reference sites reflected the greater proportion of C-4 plants in these yards.

In contrast, it has been demonstrated that heterotrophic microbial communities in soil are primarily limited by organic carbon or energy. While this concept of contrasting limitations, that is, microbial carbon and plant nutrient limitation, is based on strong evidence that we review in this paper, it is often ignored in discussions of ecosystem response to global environment changes. The plant-centric perspective has equated plant nutrient limitations with those of whole ecosystems, thereby ignoring the important role of the heterotrophs responsible for soil decomposition in driving ecosystem carbon storage. To truly integrate carbon and nutrient cycles in ecosystem science, we must account for the fact that while plant productivity may be nutrient limited, the secondary productivity by heterotrophic communities is inherently carbon limited. Ecosystem carbon cycling integrates the independent physiological responses of its individual components, as well as tightly coupled exchanges between autotrophs and heterotrophs. To the extent that the interacting autotrophic and heterotrophic processes are controlled by organisms that are limited by nutrient versus carbon accessibility, respectively, we propose that ecosystems by definition cannot be `limited' by nutrients or carbon alone. Here, we outline how models aimed at predicting non-steady state ecosystem responses over time can benefit from dissecting ecosystems into the organismal components and their inherent limitations to better represent plant-microbe interactions in coupled carbon and nutrient models.","2020-04","2020-10-01 03:36:01","2020-10-09 19:11:11","","1953-1961","","4","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\LUIRP66L\Soong et al. - 2020 - Microbial carbon limitation The need for integrat.pdf","","Carbon Cycle; Journal Article; Processes; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the time course of carbon release from CWD is not well understood. We compiled CWD decomposition rate-constants (i.e., k) to examine how tree species, piece diameter, position (i.e., standing versus downed), canopy openness, and macroclimate influenced k. To illustrate their implications we modeled the effect of species and position on estimates of decomposition-related carbon flux. We examined a subset of currently used models to determine if their structure accounted for these factors. Results Globally k of downed CWD varied at least 244-fold with interspecies variation at individual sites up to 76-fold. While k generally decreased with increasing piece diameter, under open canopies the opposite occurred. Standing CWD sometimes exhibited little decomposition, but sometimes had k values up to 3 times faster than downed CWD. There was a clear response of k to mean annual temperature of approximate to 2.6 times per 10 celcius; however, there was considerable variation for a given mean annual temperature related to species, diameter, and position. A key feature of carbon release from CWD after disturbance was the “evolution” of the ecosystem-level k value as positions and species mixtures of the remaining CWD changed. Variations in decomposition caused by disturbance (e.g., changes in species, positions, sizes, and microclimate) had the potential to cause net carbon fluxes to the atmosphere to be highly nonlinear. While several models currently being used for carbon accounting and assessing land-use/climate change would potentially capture some of these post disturbance changes in fluxes and carbon balances, many would not. Conclusions While much has been learned in the last 5 decades about CWD decomposition, to fully understand the time course of carbon release from increased mortality and other aspects of global change a new phase of global CWD research that is more systematic, experimental, and replicated needs to be initiated. If our findings are to be fully applied in modeling, an approach acknowledging how the rate of carbon release evolves over time should be implemented.","2020-01-15","2020-10-01 03:36:01","2020-10-06 23:46:48","","","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8GWSUND2\Harmon et al. - 2020 - Release of coarse woody detritus-related carbon a.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Flux; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We identified three measures indicative of diverse ecosystem services (aboveground biomass, understory biodiversity, and crown length) and compared their relationships to tree species composition in intensively managed forest plantations of the Coast Range mountains of the Pacific Northwest, United States. This study was conducted in stands of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)

In this operational setting, we did not observe the positive relationship between species diversity and productivity observed in other studies, which we attributed to management practices that minimize interspecific interaction during most of the rotation. Crown length and understory species diversity were greater in mixtures of tree species than in (monospecific) monocultures. When multiple ecosystem components were considered simultaneously, mixtures of tree species outperformed monocultures. The observed relationships of the three responses to tree species composition and diversity are likely explained by differences in tree phenology, shade tolerance, disease susceptibility, and management interventions. Based on the results, management that is solely fixated on wood production homogeneously throughout the plantation may miss opportunities to provide other ecosystem services.","2020-01","2020-10-01 03:36:02","2020-10-07 00:34:14","","1-12","","1","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\K55INICT\Himes and Puettmann - 2020 - Tree species diversity and composition relationshi.pdf","","Management; Biomass; Journal Article; Oregon; Washington","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nitrogen (N) fertilizers are generally applied in this region to increase the rate of tree growth and consequently carbon (C) sequestration. However, the long-term effects of N fertilization on C and water exchanges of Douglas-fir forests are not clear. This study presents 15 years of eddy-covariance (EC) measurements of C and water fluxes above a pole-sapling-stage Douglas-fir stand on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, and determines how N fertilization with 200 kg ha(-1) of urea-N affected these fluxes over the 10-year period after fertilization. A process-based forest growth model, 3-PG, was calibrated using EC-measured C and water fluxes during the 5 pre-fertilization years, and then used to predict these fluxes for the next 10 years assuming the stand was not fertilized. The modelled C and water fluxes for the pre-fertilization years agreed well with the measurements (with R-2 values of 0.90, 0.89, and 0.89 for gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R-e) and evapotranspiration (ET), respectively) and only slightly underestimated GPP, R-e, and ET by 4%, 1%, and 3%, respectively. The effects of N fertilization on C sequestration and water use (ET) were then obtained as differences between EC-measured (fertilized stand) and modelled (unfertilized stand) fluxes. Application of N fertilizer to this stand led to a short-term (first two years) increase in GPP followed by little change over the long term. R-e increased over the short-term (first year), while it was appreciably suppressed over the long term. N fertilization resulted in an average increase in net ecosystem productivity by 170 g m(-2) year(-1) of C during 2007-2016 with interannual variation depending on annual weather conditions.

For vegetation types that had sufficient quantification of biomass by fuel type (e.g., canopy, shrub, herbaceous, fine downed wood, coarse downed wood, and organic soil layers), we developed empirical distribution estimates.

Conversion of old-growth forests into plantations and post-fire salvage logging are widespread land uses that dramatically affect structure, biomass and carbon stocks. Few studies, however, have quantified the complex responses to wildfire and land management (i.e. logging and post-fire salvage logging) over long time periods. We quantified total aboveground biomass and composition in forest stands following low, moderate, and high severity fires 15 (2002 Apple Fire) and 29 years (1991 Warner Creek Fire) following fire in low elevation, old-growth forests dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudorsuga menziesii). We also sampled post-fire responses in forest plantations (harvested prior to fire) and salvage-logged sites (harvested after fire) in the same fires. Fire severity had dramatic effects on the partitioning of total aboveground biomass (TAGS). Most of the TAGS in high severity fires was sequestered in dead trees (> 43%) and downed wood (> 29%) while live trees comprised the largest component of TAGS (> 62%) in low severity fires. In spite of differences in overstory mortality, there was no significant difference in the TAGS between the low, moderate and high severity fires 15 years following fire (Apple Fire). Similarly, there was no significant difference between the low and high severity burns 29 years following fire (Warner Creek Fire). Managed forests (salvage and plantations) had significantly lower post-fire aboveground biomass and carbon storage that the natural forests. The TAGB of salvage logged sites was 49% and 42% that of the high severity sites at the Apple Fire and Warner Creek Fire, respectively. The mean TAGS of plantations was lowest of all fire and land use scenarios. At the Warner Creek Fire, TAGS of the plantations were < 30% of that of the high severity fire sites (e.g. 326 and 984 Mg ha(-1), respectively). This equates to a difference in aboveground carbon in the managed compared to the natural stands of 553 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) at the Apple Fire and 781 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) at the Warner Creek Fire. This research highlights the management tradeoffs involving values relating to carbon storage and wood harvest following fires.","2019-12-01","2020-10-01 03:36:03","2020-10-09 18:33:55","","","","","453","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\T8ZCMN2G\Kauffman et al. - 2019 - Forest structure and biomass reflects the variable.pdf","","Fire; Biomass; Pools; Journal Article; Oregon; Land use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prescribed reduction in stand density, i.e. thinning, has been proposed as a management tool to improve forest sustainability in face of a warmer, drier future. Thinning should potentially reduce net stand water use and improve water-availability for remaining trees, thus reducing their subsequent drought vulnerability. However, few studies have directly measured these effects. In 2009 we established a large-scale thinning experiment in a semi-arid, 40-years-old pine afforestation. Study plots (70 x 70 m) were thinned to 100,200, and 300 trees ha(-1), and compared with unthinned control plots (210-400 trees ha(-1)), each at five replications. Stem and needle growth, and needle gas exchange were measured along 3-9 consecutive years at seasonal to annual temporal resolution. Measurements at the tree-scale were further up-scaled using both simple upscaling relationships and using an ecosystem model of coupled carbon, energy and hydrology (Regional Hydro Ecologic Simulation System, RHESSys). At the needle scale, photosynthesis was 70% higher at the 100 trees ha(-1) than at 300 trees ha(-1), whereas transpiration was merely 10% higher. Consequently, stem and needle growth increased by 100% and 20%, respectively. For most parameters, there was little change between 200 and 100 trees ha(-1). Applying RHESSys at the stand-scale, these effects on tree physiology translated into 35% reduction in CO2 uptake and a 47% reduction in tree water-use, which was compensated for by increased evaporation from exposed soil. Our long-term measurements at the dry timberline highlight the role of thinning in enhancing the activity and growth of remaining trees, with increased water-use efficiency. Unexpectedly, this density reduction was associated with a relatively small decrease in forest carbon uptake. Light availability was a limiting factor in the higher density plots, even in our light-abundant forest.","2019-12-01","2020-10-01 03:36:03","2021-12-07 19:45:09","","","","","453","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\839NCDNA\Tsamir et al. - 2019 - Stand density effects on carbon and water fluxes i.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Flux; Silviculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analysis shows that the model qualitatively captures inter-daily and seasonal variability of observed RZSM at seven flux tower sites (r = 0.59 +/- 0.26 and r = 0.70 +/- 0.22 for 0-10 and 10-40 cm of soil layers, respectively; P < 0.001).

The regional carbon fluxes predicted by the native and RZSM-constrained model were used to quantify sensitivities of gross primary productivity, autotrophic respiration (R-a), heterotrophic respiration (R-h), and net ecosystem exchange to variation in RZSM. Gross primary productivity exhibited the largest sensitivity (6.6 +/- 10.7 kg center dot cm(-2)center dot year center dot theta(-1)) followed by R-a (2.9 +/- 7.3 kg center dot cm(-2)center dot year(-1)center dot theta(-1)), R-h (2.6 +/- 3.1 kg center dot cm(-2)center dot year(-1)center dot theta(-1)), and net ecosystem exchange (-1.7 +/- 7.8 kg center dot cm(-2)center dot year(-1)center dot theta(-1)). Analysis shows that these carbon flux sensitivities varied considerably across regions, reflecting influences of canopy structure, soil properties, and the ecophysiological properties of different plant functional types. This study highlights (1) the importance of improved terrestrial biosphere model predictions of RZSM to improve predictions of terrestrial carbon fluxes, (2) a need for improved pedotransfer functions, and (3) improved understanding of how soil characteristics, climate, and vegetation composition interact to govern the responses of different ecosystems to changing hydrological conditions.","2019-11","2020-10-01 03:36:04","2021-12-03 16:23:02","","3208-3231","","11","124","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\LEAU8Y3F\Zhang et al. - 2019 - The Sensitivity of North American Terrestrial Carb.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Flux; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

National forest inventories (NFIs) are important to meet international accounting goals, but data are often incomplete going back in time, and the amount of time between remeasurements can make attribution of C flux to specific events difficult. The long time series of Landsat imagery provides spatially comprehensive, consistent information that can be used to fill the gaps in ground measurements with predictive models. To evaluate such models, we relate Landsat spectral changes and disturbance interpretations directly to C flux measured on NFI plots and compare the performance of models with and without ground-measured predictor variables. The study was conducted in the forests of southwest Oregon State, USA, a region of diverse forest types, disturbances, and landowner management objectives. Plot data consisted of 676 NFI plots with remeasured individual tree data over a mean interval (time 1 to time 2) of 10.0 years. We calculated change in live aboveground woody carbon (AWC), including separate components of growth, mortality, and harvest. We interpreted radiometrically corrected annual Landsat images with the TimeSync (TS) tool for a 90 m x 90 m area over each plot. Spectral time series were divided into segments of similar trajectories and classified as disturbance, recovery, or stability segments, with type of disturbance identified. We calculated a variety of values and segment changes from tasseled cap angle and distance (TCA and TCD) as potential predictor variables of C flux. Multiple linear regression was used to model AWC and net change in AWC from the TS change metrics. The TS attribution of disturbance matched the plot measurements 89% of the time regarding whether fire or harvest had occurred or not. The primary disagreement was due to plots that had been partially cut, mostly in vigorous stands where the net change in AWC over the measurement was positive in spite of cutting. The plot-measured AWC at time 2 was 86.0 +/- 78.7 Mg C ha(-1) (mean and standard deviation), and the change in AWC across all plots was 3.5 +/- 33 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). The best model for AWC based solely on TS and other mapped variables had an R-2 = 0.52 (RMSE = 54.6 Mg C ha(-1)); applying this model at two time periods to estimate net change in AWC resulted in an R-2 = 0.25 (RMSE = 28.3 Mg ha(-1)) and a mean error of -5.4 Mg ha(-1). The best model for AWC at time 2 using plot measurements at time 1 and TS variables had an R-2 = 0.95 (RSME = 17.0 Mg ha(-1)). The model for net change in AWC using the same data was identical except that, because the variable being estimated was smaller in magnitude, the R-2 = 0.73. All models performed better at estimating net change in AWC on TS-disturbed plots than on TS-undisturbed plots. The TS discrimination of disturbance between fire and harvest was an important variable in the models because the magnitude of spectral change from fire was greater for a given change in AWC. Regional models without plot-level predictors produced erroneous predictions of net change in AWC for some of the forest types. Our study suggests that, in spite of the simplicity of applying a single carbon model to multiple image dates, the approach can produce inaccurate estimates of C flux. Although models built with plot-level predictors are necessarily constrained to making predictions at plot locations, they show promise for providing accurate updates or back-calculations of C flux assessments.","2019-11","2020-10-01 03:36:04","2020-10-06 22:40:40","","","","11","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\WJTIS4TZ\Gray et al. - 2019 - Integrating TimeSync Disturbance Detection and Rep.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is important to understand and quantify how forest carbon fluxes respond to heat and drought stress. In this study, we developed a series of daily indices of sensitivity to heat and drought stress as indicated by air temperature (T-a) and evaporative fraction (EF). Using normalized daily carbon fluxes from the FLUXNET Network for 34 forest sites in North America, the seasonal pattern of sensitivities of net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (RE) in response to T-a and EF anomalies were compared for different forest types. The results showed that warm temperatures in spring had a positive effect on NEP in conifer forests but a negative impact in deciduous forests. GEP in conifer forests increased with higher temperature anomalies in spring but decreased in summer. The drought-induced decrease in NEP, which mostly occurred in the deciduous forests, was mostly driven by the reduction in GEP. In conifer forests, drought had a similar dampening effect on both GEP and RE, therefore leading to a neutral NEP response. The NEP sensitivity to T-a anomalies increased with increasing mean annual temperature. Drier sites were less sensitive to drought stress in summer. Natural forests with older stand age tended to be more resilient to the climate stresses compared to managed younger forests. The results of the Classification and Regression Tree analysis showed that seasons and ecosystem productivity were the most powerful variables in explaining the variation of forest sensitivity to heat and drought stress. Our results implied that the magnitude and direction of carbon flux changes in response to climate extremes are highly dependent on the seasonal dynamics of forests and the timing of the climate extremes.","2020-02","2020-10-01 03:36:04","2020-10-14 15:59:41","","901-918","","2","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\DZWF3BXE\Xu et al. - 2020 - Seasonal variability of forest sensitivity to heat.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New data have upended the traditional model of stabilization, which held that stable SOM was mostly made of undecomposed plant molecules. We now know that microbial by-products and dead cells comprise unexpectedly large amounts of stable SOM because they can become attached to mineral surfaces or physically protected within soil aggregates. SOM models have been built to incorporate the microbial to mineral stabilization of organic matter, but now face a new challenge of accurately capturing microbial productivity and metabolism. Explicitly representing stoichiometry, the relative nutrient requirements for growth and maintenance of organisms, could provide a way forward. Stoichiometry limits SOM formation and turnover in nature, but important nutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) are often missing from the new generation of SOM models. In this synthesis, we seek to facilitate the addition of these nutrients to SOM models by (1) reviewing the stoichiometric bias-the tendency to favor one element over another-of four key processes in the new framework of SOM cycling and (2) applying this knowledge to build a stoichiometrically explicit budget of C, N, P, and S flow through the major SOM pools. By quantifying the role of stoichiometry in SOM cycling, we discover that constraining the C:N:P:S ratio of microorganisms and SOM to specific values reduces uncertainty in C and nutrient flow as effectively as using microbial C use efficiency (CUE) parameters. We find that the value of additional constraints on stoichiometry vs. CUE varies across ecosystems, depending on how precise the available data are for that ecosystem and which biogeochemical pathways are present. Moreover, because CUE summarizes many different processes, stoichiometric measurements of key soil pools are likely to be more robust when extrapolated from soil incubations to plot or biome scale estimates. Our results suggest that measuring SOM stoichiometry should be a priority for future empirical work and that the inclusion of new nutrients in SOM models may be an effective way to improve precision.","2019-10-10","2020-10-01 03:36:05","2020-10-05 17:25:56","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\MS2A5MUV\Buchkowski et al. - 2019 - Constraining Carbon and Nutrient Flows in Soil Wit.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is significant heterogeneity in salinity influences on TAI soil biogeochemical function. This heterogeneity is perhaps related to unrecognized mechanisms associated with carbon (C) chemistry and microbial communities. To investigate this potential, we evaluated hypotheses associated with salinity-associated shifts in organic C thermodynamics; biochemical transformations; and nitrogen-, phosphorus-, and sulfur-containing heteroatom organic compounds in a first-order coastal watershed on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, USA. In contrast to our hypotheses, thermodynamic favorability of water-soluble organic compounds in shallow soils decreased with increasing salinity (43-867 mu S cm(-1)), as did the number of inferred biochemical transformations and total heteroatom content. These patterns indicate lower microbial activity at higher salinity that is potentially constrained by accumulation of less-favorable organic C. Furthermore, organic compounds appeared to be primarily marine- or algae-derived in forested floodplain soils with more lipid-like and protein-like compounds, relative to upland soils that had more lignin-, tannin-, and carbohydrate-like compounds. Based on a recent simulation-based study, we further hypothesized a relationship between C chemistry and the ecological assembly processes governing microbial community composition. Null modeling revealed that differences in microbial community composition - assayed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing - were primarily the result of limited exchange of organisms among communities (i.e., dispersal limitation). This results in unstructured demographic events that cause community composition to diverge stochastically, as opposed to divergence in community composition being due to deterministic selection-based processes associated with differences in environmental conditions. The strong influence of stochastic processes was further reflected in there being no statistical relationship between community assembly processes (e.g., the relative influence of stochastic assembly processes) and C chemistry (e.g., heteroatom content). This suggests that microbial community composition does not have a mechanistic or causal linkage to C chemistry. The salinity-associated gradient in C chemistry was, therefore, likely influenced by a combination of spatially structured inputs and salinity-associated metabolic responses of microbial communities that were independent of community composition. We propose that impacts of salinity on coastal soil biogeochemistry need to be understood in the context of C chemistry, hydrologic or depositional dynamics, and microbial physiology, while microbial composition may have less influence.","2019-10-10","2020-10-01 03:36:05","2021-12-07 16:08:23","","3911-3928","","19","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\6YFWD5KV\Sengupta et al. - 2019 - Spatial gradients in the characteristics of soil-c.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Soil; Aquatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

End uses for compost vary and can include use as a soil conditioner for existing turf, to establish new turf, for tree planting, in urban agriculture, and for use along highway right-of-ways. The carbon benefits/costs of biosolids compost were modeled for King County, Washington. Soil carbon sequestration was highest for use on disturbed soils such as new housing developments, neglected urban soils, or highway right-of-ways (-1.1 Mg CO2eq per Mg compost) and lowest for use in well-tended yards or other highly maintained landscapes (-0.036 Mg CO2eq per Mg compost). Compost use for tree growth, calculated over a 30-year period, added above-ground sequestration benefits ranging from -1.53 Mg CO2eq per Mg compost for a mature tree grown on a healthy soil to -4.58 Mg CO2eq per Mg compost for a newly planted tree grown on a disturbed site. Assuming a 20 km haul distance, transport costs ranged from 0.005 Mg CO2eq per Mg compost for delivery in a 5 Mg truck to 0.09 Mg CO2eq per Mg compost for pick up in a personal vehicle. Ecosystem services associated with different end uses for compost in urban areas also vary. This model suggests that while uses for biosolids compost will likely be varied, for a program as a whole, significant carbon benefits can be expected.","2019-10-02","2020-10-01 03:36:05","2020-10-05 17:25:56","","227-239","","4","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\7XKKQ9JM\Brown and Beecher - 2019 - Carbon Accounting for Compost Use in Urban Areas.pdf","","Journal Article; Urban forest; Soil; Washington","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the future direction and magnitude of the land sink is highly uncertain. We examined how historical and projected changes in climate, land use, and ecosystem disturbances affect the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems in California over the period 2001-2100. We modeled 32 unique scenarios, spanning 4 land use and 2 radiative forcing scenarios as simulated by four global climate models. Between 2001 and 2015, carbon storage in California's terrestrial ecosystems declined by -188.4 Tg C, with a mean annual flux ranging from a source of -89.8 Tg C/year to a sink of 60.1 Tg C/year. The large variability in the magnitude of the state's carbon source/sink was primarily attributable to interannual variability in weather and climate, which affected the rate of carbon uptake in vegetation and the rate of ecosystem respiration. Under nearly all future scenarios, carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems was projected to decline, with an average loss of -9.4% (-432.3 Tg C) by the year 2100 from current stocks. However, uncertainty in the magnitude of carbon loss was high, with individual scenario projections ranging from -916.2 to 121.2 Tg C and was largely driven by differences in future climate conditions projected by climate models. Moving from a high to a low radiative forcing scenario reduced net ecosystem carbon loss by 21% and when combined with reductions in land-use change (i.e., moving from a high to a low land-use scenario), net carbon losses were reduced by 55% on average. However, reconciling large uncertainties associated with the effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 is needed to better constrain models used to establish baseline conditions from which ecosystem-based climate mitigation strategies can be evaluated.","2019-10","2020-10-01 03:36:05","2021-03-03 22:17:32","","3334-3353","","10","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\9KR4CTVM\Sleeter et al. - 2019 - Effects of 21st-century climate, land use, and dis.pdf","","Journal Article; California; Disturbance; Land use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite widespread evidence that trees are capable of adjusting to changes in environment across both space and time through modifying carbon allocation to leaves, many vegetation models use fixed carbon allocation schemes independent of environment, which introduces large uncertainties into predictions of future forest responses to atmospheric CO2 fertilization and anthropogenic climate change. Here, we develop an optimization-based model, whereby tree carbon allocation to leaves is an emergent property of environment and plant hydraulic traits. Using a combination of meta-analysis, observational datasets, and model predictions, we find strong evidence that optimal hydraulic-carbon coupling explains observed patterns in leaf allocation across large environmental and CO2 concentration gradients. Furthermore, testing the sensitivity of leaf allocation strategy to a diversity in hydraulic and economic spectrum physiological traits, we show that plant hydraulic traits in particular have an enormous impact on the global change response of forest leaf area. Our results provide a rigorous theoretical underpinning for improving carbon cycle predictions through advancing model predictions of leaf area, and underscore that tree-level carbon allocation to leaves should be derived from first principles using mechanistic plant hydraulic processes in the next generation of vegetation models.","2019-10","2020-10-01 03:36:05","2020-10-10 00:09:39","","3395-3405","","10","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ZBM8G7DR\Trugman et al. - 2019 - Climate and plant trait strategies determine tree .pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Growth; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aboveground biomass (AGB) response to manual grubbing release from shrub competition was compared with no release control in a twelve-year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson) plantation established after a wildfire in northeastern California. In addition, response to chemical release followed by precommercial thinning in an adjacent plantation was also examined as a growth potential from a more intensively managed regime, where shrub competition was virtually eliminated. We measured AGB in both planted trees and competing woody shrubs to partition the biomass pools in the plantation. The results showed a significant grubbing treatment effect on basal diameter (BD) at 10 cm aboveground (p = 0.02), but not on tree height (p = 0.055). Height and BD were 2.0 m and 7.4 cm in the manual release, respectively, compared to 1.7 m and 5.6 cm in the control. However, chemical release produced much greater rates of tree growth with a height of 3.6 m and BD of 14.7 cm, respectively. Tree AGB was 60% higher with the manual release of shrubs (1.2 Mg ha(-1)) than with control (0.7 Mg ha(-1)) (p < 0.05). The planted area without shrub competition yielded a much higher green tree biomass (16.0 Mg ha(-1)). When woody shrub biomass was included, the total AGB (trees and woody shrubs) appeared slightly higher, but non-significant in the no release control (13.3 Mg ha(-1)) than in the manual release (11.9 Mg ha(-1)) (p = 0.66); the chemical release had 17.1 Mg ha(-1). Clearly, shrub biomass dominated this young plantation when understory shrubs were not completely controlled. Although the manual release did increase targeted tree growth to some degree, the cost may limit this practice to a smaller scale and the remaining shrub dominance may create long-term reductions in growth and a persistent fuels problem in these fire-prone ecosystems.","2019-09","2020-10-01 03:36:05","2020-10-08 19:54:23","","","","9","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\FFV6595Z\Ritchie et al. - 2019 - Aboveground Biomass Response to Release Treatments.pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; Growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Precipitation regime shift and permafrost thaw due to climate change will likely trigger changes in fen plant community structure through shifts in these PFGs, and it is thus crucial to understand how these PFGs will impact carbon cycling and greenhouse gas dynamics to predict and model peatland-climate feedbacks. In this study, we detail the above and belowground effects of these PFGs on aspects of carbon cycling using a mesocosm approach. We hypothesized that PFGs capable of aerating the rhizosphere (sedges, horsetails, and grasses) would oxidize the belowground environment supporting higher redox potentials, a favorable environment for decomposition, and higher CO2:CH4 in pore water and gas efflux measurements than PFGs lacking aerenchyma (cinquefoil, unplanted control). Overall, sedges, horsetail and grasses had an oxidizing effect on rhizosphere pore water chemistry, producing an environment more favorable for methanotrophy during the growing season, as supported by an approximate isotopic enrichment of pore water methane (delta(CH4)-C-13) by 5 parts per thousand, and isotopic depletion in pore water carbon dioxide (delta(CO2)-C-13) by 10 parts per thousand, relative to cinquefoil treatments. Cinquefoil and unplanted control treatments fostered a reducing environment more favorable for methanogenesis. In addition, cinquefoil appeared to slow decomposition in comparison with the other PFGs. These findings, paired with PFG effects on oxidation-reduction potential and CO2 and CH4 production, point to the ability of rich fen plant communities to moderate biogeochemistry, specifically carbon cycling, in response to changing climatic conditions.","2019-09","2020-10-01 03:36:06","2020-10-08 19:54:23","","305-327","","3","144","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\XMMANCVR\Rupp et al. - 2019 - Plant functional group effects on peat carbon cycl.pdf","","Wetlands; Journal Article; Processes; Alaska","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, it is important to understand the major drivers of the land carbon uptake to make informed decisions on climate change mitigation policies. In this paper, we assess the major drivers of the land carbon uptake-CO2 fertilization, nitrogen deposition, climate change, and land use/land cover changes (LULCC)-from existing literature for the historical period and future scenarios, focusing on the results from fifth Coupled Models Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The existing literature shows that the LULCC fluxes have led to a decline in the terrestrial carbon stocks during the historical period, despite positive contributions from CO2 fertilization and nitrogen deposition. However, several studies find increases in the land carbon sink in recent decades and suggest that CO2 fertilization is the primary driver (up to 85%) of this increase followed by nitrogen deposition (similar to 10%-20%). For the 21st century, terrestrial carbon stocks are projected to increase in the majority of CMIP5 simulations under the representative concentration pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6), RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, mainly due to CO2 fertilization. These projections indicate that the effects of nitrogen deposition in future scenarios are small (similar to 2%-10%), and climate warming would lead to a loss of land carbon. The vast majority of the studies consider the effects of only one or two of the drivers, impairing comprehensive assessments of the relative contributions of the drivers. Further, the broad range in magnitudes and scenario/model dependence of the sensitivity factors pose challenges in unambiguous projections of land carbon uptake. Improved representation of processes such as LULCC, fires, nutrient limitation and permafrost thawing in the models are necessary to constrain the present-day carbon cycle and for more accurate future projections.","2019-09","2020-10-01 03:36:06","2020-10-09 23:52:47","","","","9","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\6QE5WLQZ\Tharammal et al. - 2019 - A review of the major drivers of the terrestrial c.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we compare these processes in a formerly diked, sparsely vegetated, restored salt marsh (Six Gill Slough, SG), whose surface is subsided relative to the tidal frame, to an adjacent, relatively pristine, historic salt marsh (Animal Slough, AS). Six sediment cores were collected at both AS and SG approximately 6 years after restoration. Cores were analyzed for bulk density (BD), % loss of ignition, % organic carbon, and Pb-210. We found that sharp changes in BD in surface layers of SG cores were highly reliable markers for the onset of restoration. The mean VA since restoration at SG (0.79 [SD = 0.29] cm/year) was approximately twice that of AS (0.41 [SD = 0.16] cm/year). In comparison, the VA at AS over 50 years was 0.30 (SD = 0.09) cm/year. VA consisted almost entirely of inorganic sediment at SG whereas at AS it was approximately 55%. Mean CARs at SG were somewhat greater than at AS, but the difference was not significant due to high variability (SG: 81-210 g C m(-2) year(-1); AS: 115-168 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The mean CAR at AS over the past 50 years was 118 (SD = 23) g C m(-2) year(-1). This study demonstrates that a sparsely vegetated, restored salt marsh can quickly begin to accumulate carbon and that historic and restored marshes can have similar CARs despite highly divergent formation processes.","2019-09","2020-10-01 03:36:06","2020-10-05 22:59:42","","1117-1127","","5","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\GM9B3AQT\Drexler et al. - 2019 - Carbon accumulation and vertical accretion in a re.pdf","","Wetlands; Pools; Journal Article; Flux; Aquatic; Washington","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we synthesized ecosystem carbon-cycling data from 1,119 experiments performed over the past four decades concerning changes in temperature, precipitation, CO2 and nitrogen across major terrestrial vegetation types of the world. Most experiments manipulated single rather than multiple global change drivers in temperate ecosystems of the USA, Europe and China. The magnitudes of warming and elevated CO2 treatments were consistent with the ranges of future projections, whereas those of precipitation changes and nitrogen inputs often exceeded the projected ranges. Increases in global change drivers consistently accelerated, but decreased precipitation slowed down carbon-cycle processes. Nonlinear (including synergistic and antagonistic) effects among global change drivers were rare. Belowground carbon allocation responded negatively to increased precipitation and nitrogen addition and positively to decreased precipitation and elevated CO2. The sensitivities of carbon variables to multiple global change drivers depended on the background climate and ecosystem condition, suggesting that Earth system models should be evaluated using site-specific conditions for best uses of this large dataset. Together, this synthesis underscores an urgent need to explore the interactions among multiple global change drivers in under-represented regions such as semi-arid ecosystems, forests in the tropics and subtropics, and Arctic tundra when forecasting future terrestrial carbon-climate feedback.","2019-09","2020-10-01 03:36:06","2020-10-09 19:11:11","","1309-1320","","9","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\4K7RPN6G\Song et al. - 2019 - A meta-analysis of 1,119 manipulative experiments .pdf","","Carbon Cycle; Journal Article; Processes; Meta-analysis; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present a data-driven global quantification of the eCO(2) effect on biomass based on 138 eCO(2) experiments. The strength of CO2 fertilization is primarily driven by nitrogen (N) in similar to 65% of global vegetation and by phosphorus (P) in similar to 25% of global vegetation, with N- or P-limitation modulated by mycorrhizal association. Our approach suggests that CO2 levels expected by 2100 can potentially enhance plant biomass by 12 +/- 3% above current values, equivalent to 59 +/- 13 PgC. The globalscale response to eCO(2) we derive from experiments is similar to past changes in greenness(9) and bio-mass(10) with rising CO2, suggesting that CO2 will continue to stimulate plant biomass in the future despite the constraining effect of soil nutrients.

Since production of these residues is characterized by complex spatial patterns that can shift markedly over time, and since residues may comprise roughly one-fifth of annual refinery operating costs, careful evaluation of residue supply (quantity/price) behavior is warranted. We examine potential residue supply characteristics at two likely refinery sites (Longview, WA and Springfield, OR) using a projection model of the regional log market that explicitly recognizes: (i) spatial locations of harvesting activities, (ii) the transportation network and residue haul costs, and (iii) the underlying conditions of the forest resource that determine harvesting methods and residue collection costs. We find that delivered residue prices in the range of $US64-75/bone dry metric tonne (BDMT) would be required to provide the 771,100 BDMT per year needed by a minimum commercial-sized refinery operation. Timber ownership and spatial harvesting patterns could give the Longview location nearly a $US12/BDMT wood cost advantage over Springfield at this minimum supply level, and operation of the Longview site would limit Springfield's ability to meet the minimum supply volume. Scenario analyses of lower residue collection costs indicate that a 1% reduction in costs could yield 0.6-0.9% increases in delivered supply at both refinery sites in the neighborhood of the minimum scale of commercial operation. Simulations of tripled residue output from federal lands, assuming RIN eligibility, suggest 15-30% increases in delivered residue supply at Springfield but only 0-10% increases at Longview, reflecting greater area and closer proximity of federal lands at Springfield.","2019-09","2020-10-01 03:36:07","2021-12-07 18:46:24","","","","","106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\BG4ENJLT\Adams et al. - 2019 - The importance of incorporating intertemporal and .pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; Wood products; Oregon; Washington; Economics; Fuel wood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A long-term trial in California's Mediterranean climate revealed impacts of management on SOC in maize-tomato and wheat-fallow cropping systems. SOC was measured at the initiation of the experiment and at year 19, at five depth increments down to 2 m, taking into account changes in bulk density. Across the entire 2 m profile, SOC in the wheat-fallow systems did not change with the addition of N fertilizer, winter cover crops (WCC), or irrigation alone and decreased by 5.6% with no inputs. There was some evidence of soil C gains at depth with both N fertilizer and irrigation, though high variation precluded detection of significant changes. In maize-tomato rotations, SOC increased by 12.6% (21.8 Mg C/ha) with both WCC and composted poultry manure inputs, across the 2 m profile. The addition of WCC to a conventionally managed system increased SOC stocks by 3.5% (1.44 Mg C/ha) in the 0-30 cm layer, but decreased by 10.8% (14.86 Mg C/ha) in the 30-200 cm layer, resulting in overall losses of 13.4 Mg C/ha. If we only measured soil C in the top 30 cm, we would have assumed an increase in total soil C increased with WCC alone, whereas in reality significant losses in SOC occurred when considering the 2 m soil profile. Ignoring the subsoil carbon dynamics in deeper layers of soil fails to recognize potential opportunities for soil C sequestration, and may lead to false conclusions about the impact of management practices on C sequestration.","2019-11","2020-10-01 03:36:08","2020-10-09 23:39:20","","3753-3766","","11","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\67MLDWHN\Tautges et al. - 2019 - Deep soil inventories reveal that impacts of cover.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Sequestration; Soil; Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we analyzed historical time trends in stemwood biomass growth derived from black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) trees at 248 plots across Canada. The sample consisted of trees that were live and dominant at the time of sampling (LDS). Observations of stemwood biomass of LDS trees at a reference age of 75 years (B-sw75,B-LDS) increased by 154 to 321% over 1901-2001 depending on the method of trend estimation. Simulations from a calibrated individual-based Growth and Yield model-forced with varying degrees of hypothetical trend in tree growth-were used to estimate the proportion of trend that could be attributed to intrinsic factors, including artefacts introduced by sampling from LDS trees instead of from the population of trees. Imposing no time trend in simulated tree growth, stemwood biomass of 75-year-old LDS trees (B-sw75,B-LDS,B-Model) increased by 63% (41 to 85% CI). We conclude that the remaining variation in growth of LDS trees (154 to 321% minus 63% = 91 to 258%) can be attributed to net extrinsic forcing. The scaling relationship between LDS and population trees further suggested that stemwood biomass growth of the population (G(sw75,POP)) increased by 47 to 82%. By accounting for both natural dynamics and artefacts of the sampling design in estimation of net intrinsic forcing, we gained confidence that growth rate of black spruce trees across Canada increased significantly over 1901-2001. While growth enhancement is consistent with beneficial effects of increasing levels of reactive nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and warming, there remains uncertainty in the degree that applied procedures fully account for known sampling artefacts.","2019-08","2020-10-01 03:36:08","2020-10-07 00:23:54","","2460-2480","","8","124","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\3EDU22VX\Hember et al. - 2019 - Tree Ring Reconstructions of Stemwood Biomass Indi.pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; Boreal; Growth; British Columbia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forest fires are becoming more frequent and severe, yet gaps exist in the modeling of fire on vegetation and carbon dynamics. Strategies for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from wildfires include increasing tree harvest, largely based on the public assumption that fires burn live forests to the ground, despite observations indicating that less than 5% of mature tree biomass is actually consumed. This misconception is also reflected though excessive combustion of live trees in models. Here, we show that regional emissions estimates using widely implemented combustion coefficients are 59%-83% higher than emissions based on field observations. Using unique field datasets from before and after wildfires and an improved ecosystem model, we provide strong evidence that these large overestimates can be reduced by using realistic biomass combustion factors and by accurately quantifying biomass in standing dead trees that decompose over decades to centuries after fire (”snags”). Most model development focuses on area burned; our results reveal that accurately representing combustion is also essential for quantifying fire impacts on ecosystems. Using our improvements, we find that western US forest fires have emitted 232 +/- 62 Tg CO2 (similar to half of alternative estimates) over the last 17 years, which is minor compared to 4,400 Tg CO2 from fossil fuels across the region.","2019-11","2020-10-01 03:36:08","2020-10-09 20:33:25","","3985-3994","","11","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\638XZVAV\Stenzel et al. - 2019 - Fixing a snag in carbon emissions estimates from w.pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our sites span a natural gradient of forest productivity where climate variability and edaphic conditions delineate marked differences in baseline productivity (approximately threefold). Experimental herbicide application and fertilization significantly reduced competition and improved tree growth by 1.4- to 2.2-fold across sites. At the site of lowest productivity, where soils are poorly developed and water limiting, tree growth increased strongly in response to understory suppression. Small but significant improvements in tree growth were observed in response to understory suppression at the moderate-productivity site. At the site of highest productivity, where climate is favorable and soils well developed, fertilization increased productivity to a greater extent than did understory suppression. In most cases, the effect of understory suppression and fertilization caused an unexpected growth release, exceeding the anticipated maximum productivity by >5 m of additional height and 60-100% more basal area. At the site of highest productivity, however, understory suppression caused a weak increase on late-season growth compared to fertilization alone, suggesting a beneficial effect of understory vegetation on long-term growth at that site. Tree ring cellulose carbon isotopes indicate a negative relationship between intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) and tree growth in control stands, which shifted to a positive relationship as both iWUE and tree growth increased in response to management. Cellulose oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) were positively correlated with iWUE and negatively correlated with vapor pressure deficit across sites, but delta O-18 was not a strong predictor of tree growth.","2019-07","2020-10-01 03:36:09","2021-12-07 19:45:09","","2321-2334","","7","124","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\I5BV67XJ\Liles et al. - 2019 - Two Decades of Experimental Manipulation Reveal Po.pdf","","Management; Biomass; Journal Article; California; Silviculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The climate sensitivity of ESB may vary with forest development from young to old-growth conditions as structure and composition shift over time and space. This study addresses knowledge gaps hindering implementation of adaptive forest management strategies to sustain ESB. We focused on a number of ESB indicators to (a) analyze associations among carbon storage, timber growth rate, and species richness along a forest development gradient; (b) test the sensitivity of these associations to climatic changes; and (c) identify hotspots of climate sensitivity across the boreal-temperate forests of eastern North America. From pre-existing databases and literature, we compiled a unique dataset of 18,507 forest plots. We used a full Bayesian framework to quantify responses of nine ESB indicators. The Bayesian models were used to assess the sensitivity of these indicators and their associations to projected increases in temperature and precipitation. We found the strongest association among the investigated ESB indicators in old forests (>170 years). These forests simultaneously support high levels of carbon storage, timber growth, and species richness. Older forests also exhibit low climate sensitivity of associations among ESB indicators as compared to younger forests. While regions with a currently low combined ESB performance benefitted from climate change, regions with a high ESB performance were particularly vulnerable to climate change. In particular, climate sensitivity was highest east and southeast of the Great Lakes, signaling potential priority areas for adaptive management. Our findings suggest that strategies aimed at enhancing the representation of older forest conditions at landscape scales will help sustain ESB in a changing world.","2019-07","2020-10-01 03:36:10","2020-10-09 23:52:47","","2446-2458","","7","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\F3LT595W\Thom et al. - 2019 - The climate sensitivity of carbon, timber, and spe.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Boreal; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methodological challenges persist regarding how best to estimate forest carbon stocks and flux at regulatory-relevant scales. Using California, USA as a case study, we compare two approaches to stock-difference forest carbon estimation for aboveground live trees: one based on ground inventories and one on land cover classification of remotely-sensed data. Previous work using ground inventory data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) showed net aboveground carbon (AGC) sequestration by live trees in California forests, while estimates using land cover classification from the Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (Landfire) showed net reductions in live tree AGC over a similar time period. We examined the discrepancy by re-analyzing the FIA inventory data through the lens of a category-change analysis based on Landfire. This analysis showed more than 50% of the live tree AGC in fewer than 4% of Landfire-equivalent categories and that the overwhelming majority (>80%) of forest area did not change height category between measurement periods. Despite the lack of categorical change, the majority of FIA plots increased in both 95th percentile tree height and in live tree AGC. These findings suggest that an approach based on observing categorical changes risks undercounting AGC sequestration resulting from growth and thus overstating the relative importance of AGC reductions that result from disturbances. This would bias AGC flux estimates downward, leading us to validate the conclusion that live trees in California were a net sink of aboveground carbon in the decade ending in 2016. Our findings suggest an inventory-based or hybrid approach is preferable to methods that depend on categorical bins for estimating AGC in disturbance-prone forest ecosystems.","2019-07","2020-10-01 03:36:10","2020-10-07 00:38:32","","","","7","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\39RBS9ME\Holland et al. - 2019 - Source or Sink A comparison of Landfire- and FIA-.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Flux; California; FIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While previous studies assessed the impact of bioenergy production from residual forest-based biomass on global warming, this life cycle assessment includes a comprehensive set of ten impact categories. Adopting a case study in a region in British Columbia, a life cycle model is applied to three locations considering four combustion and gasification technologies with different capacities (0.5 MW, 2 MW, 3 MW and 5 MW) and product outputs (electricity and/or heat). Most bioenergy supply chain scenarios showed improved environmental performance due to avoided uncontrolled combustion of residues and avoided fossil fuel combustion, particularly in the categories of acidification (+1% to -71%), eutrophication (-2% to -85%), fossil resource depletion (-2% to -84%), respiratory effects (0% to -96%), and photochemical ozone formation (+3% to -59%). Benefits were larger at locations dependent on fossil energy compared to locations dependent on hydropower. In contrast, ecotoxicity values increased in most scenarios (+460% to -11%), due to wood ash disposal. Results confirmed conversion efficiency and wood ash disposal as influencing factors in bioenergy supply chains for the investigated region, but showed a minor influence of the feedstock procurement distance. Moreover, the results emphasized the high contribution of uncontrolled bumings to the overall environmental impact of the forest biomass supply chains.","2019-07","2020-10-01 03:36:10","2021-12-07 18:49:03","","598-609","","","146","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\LYSVWCHF\Maier et al. - 2019 - Life cycle assessment of forest-based biomass for .pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; Life Cycle; British Columbia; Fuel wood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The True-fir stand, considered to be undisturbed and at a higher elevation (1820 m), stored substantially more C than the three stands at lower elevation (1360-1430 m) and that had sustained various levels of disturbance. The Mixed Conifer stand was minimally disturbed by thinning 27 yr ago. The Oak stand was moderately disturbed by two fires in the past 17 yr. The Pine Plantation stand was considered the most disturbed having been cleared and subjected to site preparation and windrowing 50 yr ago and thinned again 17 yr ago. Total C mass to a 30 cm soil depth (Mg C/ ha) was True-fir 531, Mixed Conifer 317, Oak 310, and Pine Plantation 253. Adding in soil C to 1 m depth increased total C mass to 595, 349, 404, and 345, respectively. True-fir had significantly larger C mass than the other three stands in nearly all pools measured. The three low-elevation stands, while similar to each other in total C, stored C differently in patterns that reflected their disturbance histories. Oak and Pine Plantation were very similar in detrital C stores, whereas Mixed Conifer had at least twice the C mass in both the forest floor and woody debris pools. Mixed Conifer had higher concentrations of soil C but had very low soil C mass due to considerably lower fine-soil bulk densities and higher rock contents. C pools in the forest floor and soil showed observable patterns over distances of 10-100 m that paralleled the patterns of C in the live vegetation. Total C in True-fir was equal to the large masses of old-growth conifer forests of the U. S. Pacific Northwest and likely represents a high-equilibrium level of C storage for forests of this region. The three low-elevation stands represent typical forests in various states of recovery from disturbance that are in C accumulating stages.","2019-06","2020-10-01 03:36:11","2021-12-07 19:10:34","","","","6","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\AXLMXCVE\Mattson and Zhang - 2019 - Forests in the northern Sierra Nevada of Californi.pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; California; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, a new analytical method with natural abundance radiocarbon was used to evaluate temperature sensitivities across soil carbon pools. With soils from Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska, an incubation experiment was used to evaluate soil carbon age and decomposability, disentangle the effects of temperature and substrate depletion on carbon mineralization, and compare temperature sensitivities of fast-cycling and slow-cycling carbon. Old, historically stable carbon was shown to be vulnerable to decomposition under warming. Using radiocarbon to differentiate between slow-cycling and fast-cycling carbon, temperature sensitivity was found to be invariant among pools, with a Q(10) of similar to 2 irrespective of native decomposition rate. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than chemical recalcitrance mediate the effect of warming on soil carbon mineralization.","2019-06","2020-10-01 03:36:11","2020-10-20 00:51:42","","467-473","","6","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\CCNHHVBW\Vaughn and Torn - 2019 - C-14 evidence that millennial and fast-cycling soi.pdf","","Journal Article; Soil; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important step toward greater understanding of nutrient effects on C storage involves assessing effects on different fractions of the soil C pool across a range of soil types. We quantified the combined effects of 8years of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and micronutrient fertilization on the C storage in bulk soil and in density fractions at four grassland sites in California. When averaged across sites, fertilization increased soil light fraction C by 64% relative to the control in the 0-10cm depth. The increase in light fraction C likely resulted from the fertilization-induced increase in plant C input to soil, as aboveground net primary productivity also consistently increased with fertilization across sites. Effects of fertilization on heavy fraction C were highly site specific, having positive, negative, or no effect at individual sites. The response of heavy fraction C to fertilization appeared to be related to mean annual precipitation and soil bulk density. Overall, bulk soil C concentration showed a marginally significant increase of 6% with fertilization when averaged across sites (P=0.07). Our results indicate that biomass production and soil light fraction are generally sensitive to fertilization across grasslands in California, likely contributing to increases in soil C storage. Responses of heavy fraction C, on the other hand, vary greatly among sites and may depend on climate and soil characteristics.","2019-06","2020-10-01 03:36:11","2020-10-07 19:07:46","","754-766","","4","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\INJHN4FS\Lin et al. - 2019 - Long-term Nutrient Fertilization Increased Soil Ca.pdf","","Management; Pools; Journal Article; Soil; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such die-offs are concerning given that drought and heatwave events are forecast to increase in severity and duration as climate change progresses. Quantifying consequences to carbon dynamics and storage from die-off events are critical for determining the current and future mitigation potential of forests. We took stand measurements five times over 2+ years from affected and unaffected plots across the Northern Jarrah Forest, southwestern Australia, following an acute drought/heatwave in 2011. We found a significant loss of live standing carbon (49.3 t ha(-1)), and subsequently a significant increase in the dead standing carbon pool by 6 months post-die-off. Of the persisting live trees, 38% experienced partial mortality contributing to the rapid regrowth and replenishment (82%-88%) of labile carbon pools (foliage, twigs, and branches) within 26 months. Such regrowth was not substantial in terms of net carbon changes within the timeframe of the study but does reflect the resprouting resilience of this forest type. Dead carbon generated by the die-off may persist for centuries given low fragmentation and decay rates resulting in low biogenic emission rates relative to other forest types. However, future fire may threaten persistence of both dead and live pools via combustion and mortality of live tissue and impaired regrowth capacity. Resprouting forests are commonly regarded as resilient systems, however, a changing climate could see vulnerable portions of forests become carbon sources rather than carbon sinks.","2019-05","2020-10-01 03:36:12","2021-12-07 22:32:27","","1653-1664","","5","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\E3JIGJYI\Walden et al. - 2019 - Carbon consequences of drought differ in forests t.pdf","","Journal Article; Growth; Disturbance; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we synthesize 36 site-years of continuous carbon dioxide and methane flux data from a mesonetwork of eddy covariance towers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California, USA to compute carbon and greenhouse gas budgets for drained agricultural land uses and compare these to restored deltaic wetlands. We found that restored wetlands effectively sequestered carbon and halted soil carbon loss associated with drained agricultural land uses. Depending on the age and disturbance regime of the restored wetland, many land use conversions from agriculture to restored wetland resulted in emission reductions over a 100-year timescale. With a simple model of radiative forcing and atmospheric lifetimes, we showed that restored wetlands do not begin to accrue greenhouse gas benefits until nearly a half century, and become net sinks from the atmosphere after a century.

To date, there are considerable gaps in modeling ecosystem fluxes and their responses to physiological constraints in these old-growth forests. These model shortcomings limit our ability to understand and project how the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest will respond to global climate change. This study applies the cohort-based Ecosystem Demography Model 2 (ED2) to the Wind River Experimental Forest (Washington, USA), a well-studied old-growth Douglas-fir-western hemlock ecosystem. ED2 is calibrated and validated using an extensive suite of forest inventory, eddy covariance, and biophysical observations. ED2 is able to reproduce observed forest composition and canopy structure, and carbon, water, and energy fluxes at the site. In the simulations, the effect of limited water supply on ecosystem carbon fluxes is mediated primarily by the forest's gross primary productivity (GPP) response, rather than its heterotrophic respiration response. The simulation indicates that stomata! conductance is mainly determined by soil moisture during periods of low vapor pressure deficit (VPD). However, when VPD is high, stomatal conductance is greatly reduced regardless of soil moisture status. During summer droughts, reduced soil moisture and increased VPD result in considerable stomatal closure and GPP reduction, which in turn decreases net carbon uptake. Cohort-based scheme integrates all canopy layers (species) that have distinct sensitivity to microclimate and respond distinctly to drought. This study is an initial first step to explore the potential importance of cohort-based model in simulating forest with complex structure, and to lay the foundation for applying cohort-based model at regional scales across the Pacific Northwest.","2019-04","2020-10-01 03:36:12","2020-10-07 17:16:17","","","","4","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\UQXBAT4U\Jiang et al. - 2019 - Linking tree physiological constraints with predic.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Washington","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the role of dissolved organic C (DOC) relative to gaseous fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in the C balance of these ecosystems has not often been studied. Dissolved C fluxes are important for understanding C partitioning within the peatland and the potential C drainage from it. This research was conducted in Burns Bog, a heavily impacted ecosystem near Vancouver, Canada, undergoing ecological restoration efforts by rewetting. Here we present data on (i) ecosystem-scale fluxes of CO2 (net ecosystem exchange, NEE) and CH4 (FCH4) determined by eddy covariance, (ii) evasion fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from the water surface to estimate the role of open water in ecosystem-scale fluxes, and (iii) DOC flux (fDOC) in water draining from the peatland. Our results showed that open water areas inside the footprint were a continual C source, emitting 47.0 +/- 2.4 g C.m(-2).year(-1). DOC export (15.6 g C.m(-2).year(-1)) was significant to the net ecosystem C balance, decreasing the magnitude of the eddy covariance-determined C balance (i.e., NEE + FCH4) of -45.0 +/- 16.8 g C.m(-2).year(-1) by 35%, resulting in a net ecosystem C balance (i.e., NEE + FCH4 + fDOC) of-29.7 +/- 17.0 g C.m(-2).year(-1). Most of this offset occurred during the wetter nongrowing season when gross primary production was low and fDOC was relatively high. Plain Language Summary Healthy peatlands can store large amounts of carbon, but disturbance may turn a peatland into a carbon emitter. We studied the amount of carbon entering and leaving a disturbed peatland that has recently undergone ecological restoration by rewetting. We measured climate conditions and ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes in Burns Bog, a heavily impacted raised bog in the Fraser River Delta, BC, Canada. We also collected water samples and estimated evasion fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from the open water, as well as drainage fluxes of dissolved organic carbon. From these data, we estimated the amount of carbon entering and leaving the ecosystem. We found that open water areas continually emit carbon to the atmosphere, but the ecosystem as a whole is accumulating carbon on an annual basis. Accounting for the dissolved carbon exported by water reduces the estimates of carbon accumulation based on gas fluxes alone. These results have implications for restoration management of peatlands, which mainly consist of raising the water table level, and the role of peatland ecosystems within the context of global climate change.","2019-04","2020-10-01 03:36:12","2020-10-05 19:18:58","","884-901","","4","124","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\CQHY43L6\D'Acunha et al. - 2019 - Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance of a Peat Bog Undergo.pdf","","Wetlands; Journal Article; Flux; Soil; Aquatic; DOC; British Columbia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These gases are produced and released as a result of anthropogenic activities and fossil fuel burnings which also result in depletion of soil carbon resources. Biochar has various distinctive properties, which contribute to make it an effective, economical, and eco-friendly approach for soil carbon sequestration. The versatility in physicochemical properties of biochar provides an opportunity to optimize its efficacy to obtain desired benefits. A critical review of the literature indicates that biochar and plant growth-promoting microbes have the potential to improve soil organic carbon (SOC). Recent studies have depicted a significant role of the combined application of plant growth-promoting microbes and biochar on SOC dynamics. In future, these areas need to be explored as these have the potential to improve SOC dynamics and it could be a better strategy to sustain natural resources and ultimately mitigation of the climate change.","2019-04","2020-10-01 03:36:13","2020-10-08 22:53:21","","","","4","191","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\SKUI6P8R\Sarfraz et al. - 2019 - Role of biochar and plant growth promoting rhizoba.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies of forest thinning or stand conditions after mortality events have provided indirect evidence for how competition can promote drought stress and predispose forests to severe fire and/or bark beetle outbreaks. Here, we demonstrate linkages between fire deficits and increasing drought stress through analyses of annually resolved tree-ring growth, fire scars, and carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) across a dry mixed-conifer forest landscape. Fire deficits across the study area have increased the sensitivity of leaf gas exchange to drought stress over the past >100 years. Since 1910, stand basal area in these forests has more than doubled and fire-return intervals have increased from 25 to 140 years. Meanwhile, the portion of interannual variation in tree-ring Delta C-13 explained by the Palmer Drought Severity Index has more than doubled in ca. 300-500-year-old Pinus ponderosa as well as in fire-intolerant, ca. 90-190-year-old Abies grandis. Drought stress has increased in stands with a basal area of >= 25 m(2)/ha in 1910, as indicated by negative temporal Delta C-13 trends, whereas stands with basal area <= 25 m(2)/ha in 1910, due to frequent or intense wildfire activity in decades beforehand, were initially buffered from increased drought stress and have benefited more from rising ambient carbon dioxide concentrations, [CO2], as demonstrated by positive temporal Delta C-13 trends. Furthermore, the average Delta C-13 response across all P. ponderosa since 1830 indicates that photosynthetic assimilation rates and stomatal conductance have been reduced by similar to 10% and similar to 20%, respectively, compared to expected trends due to increasing [CO2]. Although disturbance legacies contribute to local-scale intensity of drought stress, fire deficits have reduced drought resistance of mixed-conifer forests and made them more susceptible to challenges by pests and pathogens and other disturbances.","2019-04","2020-10-01 03:36:13","2020-10-10 00:45:12","","1247-1262","","4","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8QTN67C7\Voelker et al. - 2019 - Fire deficits have increased drought sensitivity i.pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This synthesis reviews recent progress in characterizing these carbon fluxes for the North American coastal ocean. Several observing networks and high-resolution regional models are now available. Recent efforts have focused primarily on quantifying the net air-sea exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2). Some studies have estimated other key fluxes, such as the exchange of organic and inorganic carbon between shelves and the open ocean. Available estimates of air-sea CO2 flux, informed by more than a decade of observations, indicate that the North American Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) acts as a sink of 160 +/- 80 Tg C yr(-1), although this flux is not well constrained. The Arctic and sub-Arctic, mid-latitude Atlantic, and mid-latitude Pacific portions of the EEZ account for 104, 62, and -3.7 Tg C yr(-1), respectively, while making up 51 %, 25 %, and 24 % of the total area, respectively. Combining the net uptake of 160 +/- 80 Tg C yr(-1) with an estimated carbon input from land of 106 +/- 30 Tg C yr(-1) minus an estimated burial of 65 +/- 55 Tg C yr(-1) and an estimated accumulation of dissolved carbon in EEZ waters of 50 +/- 25 Tg C yr(-1) implies a carbon export of 151 +/- 105 Tg C yr(-1) to the open ocean. The increasing concentration of inorganic carbon in coastal and open-ocean waters leads to ocean acidification. As a result, conditions favoring the dissolution of calcium carbonate occur regularly in subsurface coastal waters in the Arctic, which are naturally prone to low pH, and the North Pacific, where upwelling of deep, carbon-rich waters has intensified. Expanded monitoring and extension of existing model capabilities are required to provide more reliable coastal carbon budgets, projections of future states of the coastal ocean, and quantification of anthropogenic carbon contributions.","2019-03-27","2020-10-01 03:36:14","2021-12-07 17:44:20","","1281-1304","","6","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\P6ECDAQ4\Fennel et al. - 2019 - Carbon cycling in the North American coastal ocean.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Aquatic; Transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Projections show 56% to 77% increases in stomatal conductance throughout the year from 1986-2010 to 2076-2100, and 65% to 104% increases in leaf carbon assimilation between October and June over the same period. However, future dynamics of water and carbon under the RCP scenarios are affected by a 49% to 86% reduction in foliar biomass resulting from severe air temperature and humidity stress to the forest in summer. Important implications of future decreases in foliar biomass include 1) 20% to 71% decreases in annual transpiration which increase soilmoisture by 7% to 15% in summer and fall; 2) decreases in photosynthesis by 77% and soil organic matter by 62% under the high radiative forcing scenario; and 3) altered foliar and soil carbon to nitrogen stoichiometry. Potential carbon dioxide fertilization effects on vegetation are projected to 1) amplify decreases in transpiration by 4% to 9% and increases in soil moisture in summer and fall by 1% to 2%; and 2) alleviate decreases in photosynthesis by 4%; while 3) having negligible effects on the dynamics of nitrogen. Our projections suggest that future decrease in transpiration and moderate water holding capacity may mitigate soil moisture stress to the old-growth Douglas-fir forest. Future increases in nitrogen concentration in soil organic matter are projected to alleviate the decrease in net nitrogen mineralization despite a reduction in decomposition of soil organic matter by the end of the century.

To address this, we simulated water residence time (”age”) and flow path of terrestrial runoff and analyzed their mediating effect on relationships between annual runoff volume, DOC concentration, and DOC age. We applied this analysis to a snow-influenced watershed in California's Sierra Nevada (USA) across a range of soil types, elevations (90-4210 m), and years (1950-1999). Simulated increases in annual runoff volume were accompanied by younger ages (r(2) = 0.53-0.63) of DOC in quickflow, comprised of surface runoff and lateral flow through soil. Increases in annual runoff volume were also accompanied by gentler relationships between intra-annual (weekly) values of DOC concentration and runoff volume, regression-slopes of which followed a power-law relationship to annual runoff (r(2) = 0.12-0.92) for approximately 70% of the watershed. Simulations including dynamics of water age and soil temperature produced annual ages of quickflow DOC ranging from 1 to 70 days over all soil types and water years. Similarity of this range to an observed, 1-69 day range in half-lives of relatively labile DOC in previous studies suggests substantial interannual and spatial variability in the biodegradability of DOC in terrestrial runoff. Simulations excluding dynamics of water age and soil temperature predicted order-of-magnitude less interannual variability in age of quickflow DOC, demonstrating the important effect of interannual variability in soil-water interaction times. These findings suggest that the distribution of DOC bioprocessing along transitions between terrestrial and aquatic systems may be strongly influenced by year-to-year variability in age of water.

Here, we provide a tool for generating a global baseline of SOC stocks. We used partial least square (PLS) regression and available geographic datasets that describe SOC,climate, organisms, relief, parent material and time. The accuracy of the model was determined by the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of predicted SOC against 100 independent measurements. The best predictors were related toprimary productivity, climate, topography, biome classification, and soil type. The largest C stocks for the top 1 mwere found in boreal forests (254 +/- 14.3 t ha(-1)) and tundra(310 +/- 15.3 t ha(-1)). Deserts had the lowest C stocks (53.2 +/- 6.3tha(-1))and statistically similar C stocks were found for temperate and Mediterranean forests (142 - 221 t ha-1), tropical and subtropical forests (94 - 143 t ha(-1)) and grasslands (99-104 t ha(-1)). Solar radiation, evapotranspiration, and annual mean temperature were negatively correlated with SOC, whereas soil water content was positively correlated with SOC. Our model explained 49% of SOC variability, withRMSD (0.68) representing approximately 14% of observed C stock variance, overestimating extremely low and underestimating extremely high stocks, respectively. Our baseline PLS predictions of SOC stocks can be used for estimating the maximum amount of C that may be sequestered in soilsacross biomes.","2019-03","2020-10-01 03:36:14","2020-10-06 16:37:05","","355-372","","3","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\DDPAN79D\11027_2018_9815_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx; D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\Y2W8IPFT\11027_2018_9815_MOESM3_ESM.xls; D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8JNVS7YC\Duarte-Guardia et al. - 2019 - Better estimates of soil carbon from geographical .pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Soil; British Columbia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our study focussed on the assessment of SOC pools associated with alluvial floodplain soils that are affected by human-induced changes in floodplain deposition and in situ SOC mineralisation due to land use change and drainage. We evaluated depth-dependent SOC contents based on 23 soil cores down to 3 m and 10 drillings down to 7 m in a floodplain area of the lower Cosumnes River. An estimate of 266 Mg C ha(-1) or about 59% of the entire SOC stored within the 7 m profiles was found in the upper 2 m. Most profiles (n = 25) contained discrete buried A horizons at depths of approximately 0.8 m. These profiles had up to 130% higher SOC stocks. The mean delta C-13 of all deep soil profiles clearly indicated that arable land use has already altered the stable isotopic signature in the first meter of the profile. Radiocarbon dating showed that the C-14 age in the buried horizon was younger than in overlaying soils indicating a substantial sedimentation phase for the overlaying soils. An additional analysis of total mercury contents in the soil profiles indicated that this sedimentation was associated with upstream hydraulic gold mining after the 1850s. In summary, deep alluvial soils in floodplains store large amounts of SOC not yet accounted for in global carbon models. Historic data give evidence that large amounts of sediment were transported into the floodplains of most rivers of the Central Valley and deposited over organically rich topsoil, which promoted the stabilization of SOC, and needs to be considered to improve our understanding of the human-induced interference with C cycling.

However, carbon markets can encourage reforestations that focus on maximizing carbon storage, potentially at the expense of biodiversity conservation. To identify opportunities to optimize reforestation design and management to meet both goals, we examined the forest stand features associated with carbon stocks in biomass and soil, as well as bird abundance and diversity, in remnant and restored riparian forest stands in central California, U.S.A. Within three decades of reforestation, both planted and naturally regenerating riparian forest stands provided significantly greater carbon storage and avian biodiversity benefits compared to baseline conditions. They were also similar to a remnant riparian forest stand. We identified a synergy between carbon storage and biodiversity benefits in their positive associations with understorey cover, but we also identified a trade-off in their relationships to forest stand density. Biomass carbon stocks were strongly positively related to stand density, while bird density and diversity suffered at the highest stand densities. The variability in understorey cover across forest stands indicates an opportunity for further enhancement of carbon and biodiversity benefits in areas where understorey cover is low, while the variability in stand density suggests an opportunity to re-examine reforestation goals and consider thinning to achieve those goals. Synthesis and applications. We identified synergies and trade-offs between carbon storage and biodiversity in their relationships to forest stand features, indicating opportunities to optimize reforestation design and management to achieve multiple goals.

At three of the sites, impacts on the energy balance are also apparent, while the event also appears to elicit an ecosystem response with respect to carbon fluxes at the wetland and a forested site. Greatest impacts on radiation and energy budgets were observed at the forested site where the role of canopy architecture and the complex physiological responses to an increase in diffuse radiation were most important. At the forest site, the arrival of smoke reduced both sensible and latent heat flux substantially but also lowered sensible heat flux more than the latent heat flux. With widespread standing water, and little physiological control on evapotranspiration, the impacts on the partitioning of turbulent fluxes were modest at the wetland compared to the physiologically dominated fluxes at the forested site. Despite the short duration and singular nature of the event, there was some evidence of a diffuse radiation fertilization effect when AOD was near or below 2. With lighter smoke, both the wetland and forested site appeared to show enhanced photosynthetic activity (a greater sink for carbon dioxide). However, with dense smoke, the forested site was a strong carbon source. Given the extensive forest cover in the Pacific Northwest and the growing importance of forest fires in the region, these results suggest that wildfire aerosol during the growing season potentially plays an important role in the regional ecosystem response to smoke and ultimately the carbon budget of the region.","2019-01-22","2020-10-01 03:36:15","2020-10-07 22:42:58","","835-846","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\CDE4N695\McKendry et al. - 2019 - Impacts of an intense wildfire smoke episode on su.pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; Flux; British Columbia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forest vegetation management (VM) is an important component of many reforestation programs and although several studies have demonstrated the benefits of VM on planted conifer growth and survival, few reports have been published on the long-term effects of VM treatments on total ecosystem biomass accumulation. In this study we assessed the effects of two contrasting VM treatments on total tree and ecosystem biomass stock for Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, and grand fir growing in Oregon's central Coast Range (CR) and Douglas-fir and western redcedar growing in Oregon's Cascade foothills (CF). The assessments were made at age 16 years, 11 years after treatment application ended. The study contained two vegetation management treatments: control (C) and vegetation management (VM). Both the C and VM plots received a pre-planting herbicide site preparation treatment. The VM plots had, additionally, sustained vegetation control using herbicides during the first 5 years after planting. At age 16 years, at the CR site, the VM treatment increased the biomass stock of crop trees by 26.5, 91.2, 44.7, and 96.1 Mg ha(-1) for Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, and grand fir, respectively. At the same age, at the CF site, the VM treatment increased crop tree biomass stock by 48.1 Mg ha(-1) for Douglas-fir and 42.2 Mg ha(-1) for western redcedar. When other ecosystem components were considered, however, total ecosystem biomass did not differ between C and VM treated plots for western hemlock, western redcedar and grand fir at the CR site largely due to the development of an abundant hardwood midstory. On the other hand, VM treatments increased the ecosystem biomass stock of Douglas-fir and western redcedar at the site with a low abundance of hardwood midstory (CF site). Midstory biomass of C plots at the CR site averaged 52.9, 64.7, and 36.0 Mg ha(-1), for western hemlock, western redcedar, and grand fir, respectively. At the CF site, midstory biomass of C plots averaged 1.2 and 5.9 Mg ha(-1), for Douglas-fir and western redcedar, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that sustained VM treatments during the first 5 years of stand establishment increases the biomass stock of crop trees, directing site resources towards planted crop trees.","2019-01-15","2020-10-01 03:36:16","2020-10-06 21:12:05","","276-285","","","432","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\GYGDDFD3\Flamenco et al. - 2019 - Long-term effects of vegetation management on biom.pdf","","Biomass; Pools; Journal Article; Oregon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A stochastic dynamic programming model of the BC interior, which includes a detailed carbon accounting module, shows that harvests are delayed as carbon prices rise, with less carbon stored in harvested wood products and more in the forest ecosystem, but an increase in the risk of natural disturbance causes the landowner to harvest sooner. As natural disturbance increases in prevalence and severity, this will somewhat offset the lengthening of rotation age that occurs when carbon is priced. With disturbance, the total amount of carbon sequestered falls significantly, but some of this can be recovered through proactive planting of genetically modified (GM) stems that are more productive and less susceptible to disturbance. To make such an investment worthwhile, however, the costs of planting GM stock should not exceed $120-$150/ha. Finally, this study suggests that a modest price of carbon (somewhat less than $25/tCO(2)) can be an effective incentive to encourage land owners to reduce the rotation age brought about by disturbance, and generate additional carbon offsets.","2019","2020-10-01 03:36:16","2020-10-20 00:48:13","","159-185","","","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\LW7T8LL5\van Kooten et al. - 2019 - Carbon Uptake and Forest Management under Uncertai.pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Flux; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the last decade, global scale models have produced varied predictions of the size and distribution of SOC stocks, ranging from 1000 to >3000 Pg of C within the top 1m. Regional assessments may help validate or improve global maps because they can examine landscape controls on SOC stocks and offer a tractable means to retain regionally-specific information, such as soil taxonomy, during database creation and modeling. We compile a new transboundary SOC stock database for coastal water sheds of the North Pacific coastal temperate rainforest, using soil classification data to guide gap-filling and machine learning approaches to explore spatial controls on SOC and predict regional stocks. Precipitation and topographic attributes controlling soil wetness were found to be the dominant controls of SOC, underscoring the dependence of C accumulation on high soil moisture. The random forest model predicted stocks of 4.5 PgC(to 1m) for the study region, 22% of which was stored in organic soil layers. Calculated stocks of 228 +/- 111 Mg C ha(-1) fell within ranges of several past regional studies and indicate 11-33 Pg C may be stored across temperate rainforest soils globally. Predictions compared very favorably to regionalized estimates fromtwo spatially explicit global products (Pearson's correlation: rho = .0.73 versus 0.34). Notably, SoilGrids 250 m was an outlier for estimates of total SOC, predicting 4-fold higher stocks (18 Pg C) and indicating bias in this global product for the soils of the temperate rainforest. In sum our study demonstrates that CTR ecosystems represent amoisture-dependent hotspot for SOCstorage at mid-latitudes.","2019-01","2020-10-01 03:36:18","2020-10-07 22:45:13","","","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8XIS49Z9\McNicol et al. - 2019 - Large, climate-sensitive soil carbon stocks mapped.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Soil; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is emerging consensus that slow-cycling SOM generally consists of relatively low molecular weight organic carbon substrates that enter the mineral soil as dissolved organic matter and associate with mineral surfaces (referred to as “mineral-associated OM,” or MAOM). However, much debate and contradictory evidence persist around: (a) whether the organic C substrates within the MAOM pool primarily originate from aboveground vs. belowground plant sources and (b) whether C substrates directly sorb to mineral surfaces or undergo microbial transformation prior to their incorporation into MAOM. Here, we attempt to reconcile disparate views on the formation of MAOM by proposing a spatially explicit set of processes that link plant C source with MAOM formation pathway. Specifically, because belowground vs. aboveground sources of plant C enter spatially distinct regions of the mineral soil, we propose that fine-scale differences in microbial abundance should determine the probability of substrate-microbe vs. substrate-mineral interaction. Thus, formation of MAOM in areas of high microbial density (e.g., the rhizosphere and other microbial hotspots) should primarily occur through an in vivo microbial turnover pathway and favor C substrates that are first biosynthesized with high microbial carbon-use efficiency prior to incorporation in the MAOM pool. In contrast, in areas of low microbial density (e.g., certain regions of the bulk soil), MAOM formation should primarily occur through the direct sorption of intact or partially oxidized plant compounds to uncolonized mineral surfaces, minimizing the importance of carbon-use efficiency, and favoring C substrates with strong “sorptive affinity.” Through this framework, we thus describe how the primacy of biotic vs. abiotic controls on MAOM dynamics is not mutually exclusive, but rather spatially dictated. Such an understanding may be integral to more accurately modeling soil organic matter dynamics across different spatial scales.","2019-01","2020-10-01 03:36:18","2020-10-09 19:11:11","","12-24","","1","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\SEZP2ED6\Sokol et al. - 2019 - Pathways of mineral-associated soil organic matter.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Investment in riparian forest restoration has received relatively little attention, in part due to their relatively small spatial extent. Yet, riparian forest restoration may be a particularly valuable strategy because riparian forests have the potential for rapid carbon sequestration, are hotspots of biodiversity, and provide numerous valuable ecosystem services. To inform this strategy, we conducted a global synthesis and meta-analysis to identify general patterns of carbon stock accumulation in riparian forests. We compiled riparian biomass and soil carbon stock data from 117 publications, reports, and unpublished data sets. We then modeled the change in carbon stock as a function of vegetation age, considering effects of climate and whether or not the riparian forest had been actively planted. On average, our models predicted that the establishment of riparian forest will more than triple the baseline, unforested soil carbon stock, and that riparian forests hold on average 68-158 Mg C/ha in biomass at maturity, with the highest values in relatively warm and wet climates. We also found that actively planting riparian forest substantially jump-starts the biomass carbon accumulation, with initial growth rates more than double those of naturally regenerating riparian forest. Our results demonstrate that carbon sequestration should be considered a strong co-benefit of riparian restoration, and that increasing the pace and scale of riparian forest restoration may be a valuable investment providing both immediate carbon sequestration value and long-term ecosystem service returns.","2019-01","2020-10-01 03:36:18","2021-12-03 16:57:50","","57-67","","1","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\KAC65DWD\Dybala et al. - 2019 - Carbon sequestration in riparian forests A global.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current empirical approaches for estimating net ecosystem productivity (NEP) rarely consider forest age as a predictor, which represents variation in physiological processes that can respond differently to environmental drivers, and regrowth following disturbance. Here, we conduct an observational synthesis to empirically determine to what extent climate, soil properties, nitrogen deposition, forest age and management influence the spatial and interannual variability of forest NEP across 126 forest eddy-covariance flux sites worldwide. The empirical models explained up to 62% and 71% of spatio-temporal and across-site variability of annual NEP, respectively. An investigation of model structures revealed that forest age was adominant factor of NEP spatio-temporal variability in both space and time at the global scale as compared to abiotic factors, such as nutrient availability, soil characteristics and climate. These findings emphasize the importance of forest age in quantifying spatio-temporal variation in NEP using empirical approaches.","2018-12","2020-10-01 03:36:19","2020-10-01 23:03:06","","","","12","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\J972RNHP\Besnard et al. - 2018 - Quantifying the effect of forest age in annual net.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Restoration often involves mechanical thinning to promote development of complex habitats in moist, productive forests and mechanical thinning with prescribed fire to reduce fuels and restore natural disturbance regimes in dry, fire prone forests. This systematic review quantified the impact of restoration treatments on forest ecosystem carbon (C) stocks and identified factors that moderate treatment effects across spatial and temporal scales. Our review process identified 73 studies to be included for analysis, from which we calculated 482 estimates of treatment effect size. We found that restoration treatments significantly reduce C. Prescribed fire had larger impacts on belowground than aboveground carbon pools, while thinning and combined treatments had larger impacts on aboveground pools. The available literature is highly skewed toward shorter timescales ( < 25 years after treatment), small spatial scales, and is geographically concentrated: 41% of estimated effect sizes came from studies in the Sierra Nevada. Thinning had similar effects on forest carbon in dry forests and moist forests. The relative magnitude of total C losses was significantly less from simulation than empirical studies, although simulations also mostly evaluated long-term impacts ( > 75 years after treatment) while empirical studies mostly looked at short term ( < 25 year) effects. Post-treatment wildfire significantly reduced the percentage of carbon lost relative to controls in the aboveground pool. Long-term, treated stands only recovered to control levels of carbon when wildfire was present. Returns on the carbon debt imposed by thinning and prescribed fire depend on the nuances of the treatments themselves but may also depend upon treatment intensity and the frequency and intensity of future wildfire. Ecological restoration in forests across the western US has to carefully balance the budget of ecosystem carbon with competing objectives such as improved wildlife habitat, reduced risk of severe wildfire, and other ecosystem services.","2018-12-01","2020-10-01 03:36:19","2021-12-07 19:45:09","","625-641","","","429","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\48MAP8BS\James et al. - 2018 - The effects of forest restoration on ecosystem car.pdf","","Management; Pools; Journal Article; Silviculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explored SOC responses to warming and increased carbon inputs using a synthesis of 147 field manipulation experiments and five SOC models with different representations of microbial and mineral processes. Model projections diverged but encompassed a similar range of variability as the experimental results. Experimental measurements were insufficient to eliminate or validate individual model outcomes. While all models projected that CO2 efflux would increase and SOC stocks would decline under warming, nearly one-third of experiments observed decreases in CO2 flux and nearly half of experiments observed increases in SOC stocks under warming. Long-term measurements of C inputs to soil and their changes under warming are needed to reconcile modeled and observed patterns. Measurements separating the responses of mineral-protected and unprotected SOC fractions in manipulation experiments are needed to address key uncertainties in microbial degradation and mineral stabilization mechanisms. Integrating models with experimental design will allow targeting of these uncertainties and help to reconcile divergence among models to produce more confident projections of SOC responses to global changes.","2018-11","2020-10-01 03:36:19","2020-10-09 23:13:35","","109-123","","2","141","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\EKYC8JEB\Sulman et al. - 2018 - Multiple models and experiments underscore large u.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Processes; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One international network, the Detrital Input and Removal Treatment (DIRT) Project, was established to assess how rates and sources of plant litter inputs influence accumulations or losses of organic matter in forest soils. DIRT employs chronic additions and exclusions of aboveground litter inputs and exclusion of root ingrowth to permanent plots at eight forested and two shrub/grass sites to investigate how soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics are influenced by plant detrital inputs across ecosystem and soil types. Across the DIRT network described here, SOM pools responded only slightly, or not at all, to chronic doubling of aboveground litter inputs. Explanations for the slow or even negative response of SOM to litter additions include increased decomposition of new inputs and priming of old SOM. Evidence of priming includes increased soil respiration in litter addition plots, decreased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) output from increased microbial activity, and biochemical markers in soil indicating enhanced SOM degradation. SOM pools decreased in response to chronic exclusion of aboveground litter, which had a greater effect on soil C than did excluding roots, providing evidence that root-derived C is not more critical than aboveground litter C to soil C sequestration. Partitioning of belowground contributions to total soil respiration were predictable based on site-level soil C and N as estimates of site fertility; contributions to soil respiration from root respiration were negatively related to soil fertility and inversely, contributions from decomposing aboveground litter in soil were positively related to site fertility. The commonality of approaches and manipulations across the DIRT network has provided greater insights into soil C cycling than could have been revealed at a single site. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Allochthonous OC loads from the landscape, along with autochthonous OC loads from primary production, are mineralized in lakes, buried in lake sediments, and exported via surface or groundwater outflows. Although these processes provide a basis for a conceptual understanding of lake OC budgets, few studies have integrated these fluxes under a dynamic modeling framework to examine their interactions and relative magnitudes. We developed a simple, dynamic mass balance model for OC, and applied the model to a set of five lakes. We examined the relative magnitudes of OC fluxes and found that long-term (> 10 year) lake OC dynamics were predominantly driven by allochthonous loads in four of the five lakes, underscoring the importance of terrestrially-derived OC in northern lake ecosystems. Our model highlighted seasonal patterns in lake OC budgets, with increasing water temperatures and lake productivity throughout the growing season corresponding to a transition from burial- to respiration-dominated OC fates. Ratios of respiration to burial, however, were also mediated by the source (autochthonous vs. allochthonous) of total OC loads. Autochthonous OC is more readily respired and may therefore proportionally reduce burial under a warming climate, but allochthonous OC may increase burial due to changes in precipitation. The ratios of autochthonous to allochthonous inputs and respiration to burial demonstrate the importance of dynamic models for examining both the seasonal and inter-annual roles of lakes in landscape and global carbon cycling, particularly in a global change context. Finally, we highlighted critical data needs, which include surface water DOC observations in paired tributary and lake systems, measurements of OC burial rates, groundwater input volume and DOC, and budgets of particulate OC.","2018-10-24","2020-10-01 03:36:20","2020-10-07 22:39:49","","71-82","","","386","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\5EULLR3N\McCullough et al. - 2018 - Dynamic modeling of organic carbon fates in lake e.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Aquatic; DOC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As part of a proposed accounting methodology for California's cap-and-trade system, we described five riparian vegetation associations and created a tool to predict their rates of carbon accumulation under different restoration and land-use scenarios. Location: California, USA. Methods: We assembled a database of 654 forest inventory plots of known age (3-108 years) from replanted and naturally recruiting California riparian forests. We then used detrended correspondence analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering to detect vegetation structure in the plots and delineate distinct forest types. We used allometric equations to estimate biomass from individual trees' diameters and calculate total biomass for each plot. Next, we fitted sigmoid growth functions to the plot biomass data to generate expected values for live-tree biomass over a 100-year period for each forest type. Finally, we created an algorithm to match user-inputted data for an intended restoration project with a look-up table that predicts carbon accumulation appropriate to the user's scenario. Results: California riparian vegetation was divided into willow scrub, cottonwood-willow, mixed riparian, upland riparian and riparian woodland types. Total carbon sequestration in riparian vegetation and soil varied from 75.7 to 137.4 Mg C/ha at 30 years post-restoration and from 95.1 to 175.8 Mg C/ha 100 years after stand initiation. Vegetation types dominated by taller, more shade-tolerant trees developed more slowly than scrubby and pioneer stands, but came to a higher maximum biomass. Our models put riparian biomass accumulation in the range of the few extant literature values for mediterranean systems, but uncertainties are high, and soil carbon may be underestimated. Conclusions: Our workflow and methods should be transferable to the development of carbon accounting tools for any other woody vegetation type. However, our difficulty in finding appropriate published data for the analysis suggests a critical need for field surveys appropriate to biomass estimation in woodland and forest communities not exploited for timber. The most important measurements are the age of the stand and a census of tree species, height and diameter.","2018-10","2020-10-01 03:36:21","2020-10-07 22:25:16","","584-594","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\GK3H65X7\Matzek et al. - 2018 - Development of a carbon calculator tool for ripari.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we provide an estimate on the magnitude and variability of carbon stocks within a widely distributed marine foundation species throughout its distribution area in temperate Northern Hemisphere. We sampled 54 eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows, spread across eight ocean margins and 36 degrees of latitude, to determine abiotic and biotic factors influencing organic carbon (C-org) stocks in Zostera marina sediments. The C-org stocks (integrated over 25-cm depth) showed a large variability and ranged from 318 to 26,523gC/m(2) with an average of 2,721gC/m(2). The projected C-org stocks obtained by extrapolating over the top 1m of sediment ranged between 23.1 and 351.7MgC/ha, which is in line with estimates for other seagrasses and other blue carbon ecosystems. Most of the variation in C-org stocks was explained by five environmental variables (sediment mud content, dry density and degree of sorting, and salinity and water depth), while plant attributes such as biomass and shoot density were less important to C-org stocks. Carbon isotopic signatures indicated that at most sites <50% of the sediment carbon is derived from seagrass, which is lower than reported previously for seagrass meadows. The high spatial carbon storage variability urges caution in extrapolating carbon storage capacity between geographical areas as well as within and between seagrass species.","2018-10","2020-10-01 03:36:21","2020-10-08 19:54:23","","1457-1475","","10","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\JBJ6VGKY\Rohr et al. - 2018 - Blue Carbon Storage Capacity of Temperate Eelgrass.pdf","","Wetlands; Pools; Journal Article; Aquatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Persistence is commonly characterized as turnover or mean residence time of soil organic matter (SOM). However, turnover and residence times are ambiguous measures of persistence, because they could represent the concept of either age or transit time. To disambiguate these concepts and propose a metric to assess SOM persistence, we calculated age and transit time distributions for a wide range of soil organic carbon models. Furthermore, we show how age and transit time distributions can be obtained from a stochastic approach that takes a deterministic model of mass transfers among different pools and creates an equivalent stochastic model at the level of atoms. Using this approach we show the following: (1) Age distributions have relatively old mean values and long tails in relation to transit time distributions, suggesting that carbon stored in soils is on average much older than carbon in the release flux. (2) The difference between mean ages and mean transit times is large, with estimates of soil organic carbon persistence on the order of centuries or millennia when assessed using ages and on the order of decades when using transit or turnover times. (3) The age distribution is an appropriate metric to characterize persistence of SOM. An important implication of our analysis is that random chance is a factor that helps to explain why some organic matter persists for millennia in soil.","2018-10","2020-10-01 03:36:21","2020-10-09 17:55:12","","1574-1588","","10","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\LXR3IVVA\Sierra et al. - 2018 - Soil Organic Matter Persistence as a Stochastic Pr.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we synthesized six data sets over 5years from a soil warming experiment at the Eight Mile Lake, Alaska, into the Terrestrial ECOsystem (TECO) model with a probabilistic inversion approach. The TECO model used multiple soil layers to track dynamics of thawed soil under different treatments. Our results show that warming increased light use efficiency of vegetation photosynthesis but decreased baseline (i.e., environment-corrected) turnover rates of SOC in both the fast and slow pools in comparison with those under control. Moreover, the parameter changes generally amplified over time, suggesting processes of gradual physiological acclimation and functional gene shifts of both plants and microbes. The TECO model predicted that field warming from 2009 to 2013 resulted in cumulative C losses of 224 or 87g/m(2), respectively, without or with changes in those parameters. Thus, warming-induced parameter changes reduced predicted soil C loss by 61%. Our study suggests that it is critical to incorporate biotic changes in ESMs to improve the model performance in predicting C dynamics in permafrost regions.","2018-10","2020-10-01 03:36:22","2021-12-07 22:34:23","","4946-4959","","10","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\A5U6TFND\Liang et al. - 2018 - Biotic responses buffer warming-induced soil organ.pdf","","Journal Article; Soil; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rates of both these processes will increase with warming but it remains unclear which will dominate the global peatland response. Here we examine the global relationship between peatland carbon accumulation rates during the last millennium and planetary-scale climate space. A positive relationship is found between carbon accumulation and cumulative photosynthetically active radiation during the growing season for mid- to high-latitude peatlands in both hemispheres. However, this relationship reverses at lower latitudes, suggesting that carbon accumulation is lower under the warmest climate regimes. Projections under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios indicate that the present-day global sink will increase slightly until around AD 2100 but decline thereafter. Peatlands will remain a carbon sink in the future, but their response to warming switches from a negative to a positive climate feedback (decreased carbon sink with warming) at the end of the twenty-first century.","2018-10","2020-10-01 03:36:22","2021-12-07 16:13:44","","907-914","","10","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\L2SPEJPR\Gallego-Sala et al. - 2018 - Latitudinal limits to the predicted increase of th.pdf","","Wetlands; Journal Article; Flux; Soil; Aquatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As permafrost thaws in response to this warming, large amounts of soil organic matter may become vulnerable to decomposition. Microbial decomposition will release carbon (C) from permafrost soils, however, warmer conditions could also lead to enhanced plant growth and C uptake. Field and modeling studies show high uncertainty in soil and plant responses to climate change but there have been few studies that reconcile field and model data to understand differences and reduce uncertainty. Here, we evaluate gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R eco ), and net ecosystem C exchange (NEE) from eight years of experimental soil warming in moist acidic tundra against equivalent fluxes from the Community Land Model during simulations parameterized to reflect the field conditions associated with this manipulative field experiment. Over the eight-year experimental period, soil temperatures and thaw depths increased with warming in field observations and model simulations. However, the field and model results do not agree on warming effects on water table depth; warming created wetter soils in the field and drier soils in the models. In the field, initial increases in growing season GPP, R-eco, and NEE to experimentally-induced permafrost thaw created a higher C sink capacity in the first years followed by a stronger C source in years six through eight. In contrast, both models predicted linear increases in GPP, R-eco, and NEE with warming. The divergence of model results from field experiments reveals the role subsidence, hydrology, and nutrient cycling play in influencing the C flux responses to permafrost thaw, a complexity that the models are not structurally able to predict, and highlight challenges associated with projecting C cycle dynamics across the Arctic.","2018-10","2020-10-01 03:36:22","2021-12-03 19:39:38","","","","10","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\RGR9SL95\Schadel et al. - 2018 - Divergent patterns of experimental and model-deriv.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Processes; Soil; Perfmafrost; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonlinear mixed effect models (NMEM) were developed to predict total aboveground biomass as well as biomass in leaves, 1-h, 10-h, and 100 or more hour fuel classes for seven species of shrubs common to the northeastern California. Using crown area as a predictor, an allometric (power) model was used as a base model. Coefficients varied by species, component, and by a nested combination of these random effects. The results showed that NMEM that used shrub species as random effect performed better than nonlinear fixed effect models in estimating total and component biomass in shrub species used in this study. Additionally, when fixed effect models were fitted by species, not all regression parameters were statistically significant at 0.05 level of significance. NMEM were able to account for within species variation very well. The largest variation was observed in total biomass while the smallest variation was observed in the biomass in 100 or more hour fuel class. The mean prediction bias and root mean square prediction errors for total shrub biomass was 0.0409 kg and 0.9249 kg respectively. While there were differences between the fixed effects models and mixed effects models, the mixed effects models would be preferred to the fixed effect models for future studies involving total biomass prediction for similar shrub species and regions.","2018-09-15","2020-10-01 03:36:23","2020-10-07 16:27:08","","154-163","","","424","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\CZWJZP7N\Huff et al. - 2018 - Quantifying aboveground biomass for common shrubs .pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Journal Article; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the US Forest Service offers a gridded network of field plots which potentially can be linked to airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to estimate forest aboveground carbon density (ACD; units of Mg C ha(-1)). Here we utilized FIA plot and airborne LiDAR data sets collected across two contrasting landscapes known as Laupahoehoe and Pu'u Wa'awa'a on Hawai'i Island to explore strengths and weaknesses of linking those two data sets to estimate ACD. We varied FIA plot sample designs with respect to sampling density (i.e., the number of plots across landscape) and intensity (i.e., the structural detail within inventory plots) to test the capability of the mapping approach. Results indicated that Laupahoehoe and Pu'u Wa'awa'a landscapes supported an estimated 545 Gg C and 157 Gg C aboveground, respectively, and mean ACD values of the wet windward Laupahoehoe landscape (109 Mg ha(-1)) were an order of magnitude greater than those of the leeward dry Pu'u Wa'awa'a landscape (9.7 Mg ha(-1)). Patterns of ACD were largely determined by combined factors of precipitation, lava substrate, prior land use, and presence of non-native, often invasive, species. Results demonstrated the relative importance of sample plot density over sample plot intensity, and showed that FIA inventory plots, even at their lowest sample intensity design, can be linked with LiDAR data to accurately estimate ACD across spatially heterogeneous landscapes. We also developed and applied a straightforward, statistically-robust approach to provide error estimates for the 100 million pixels that characterize the Laupahoehoe and Pu'u Wa'awa'a landscapes as well as for any sub-units of those landscapes. We contend that augmenting existing FIA forest plot data with airborne LiDAR coverage, even if that requires an increase in plot density somewhat above the FIA standard 1X or 2X approaches, is a feasible, cost-effective, scientifically sound approach from which to obtain accurate landscape- to regional-scale ACD measures across the extensive and heterogeneous forests of the United States.","2018-09-15","2020-10-01 03:36:23","2020-10-07 16:27:08","","323-337","","","424","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8ZV2BTK3\Hughes et al. - 2018 - Estimating aboveground carbon density across fores.pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Journal Article; FIA; Hawai'i","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We quantified the impacts of the 2011 and 2012 droughts on terrestrial ecosystem carbon uptake anomalies over the contiguous US (CONUS) relative to non-drought years during 2010-2015 using satellite observations and the carbon monitoring system-flux inversion modeling framework. Soilmoisture and temperature anomalies are good predictors of gross primary production anomalies (R-2 > 0.6) in summer but less so for net biosphere production (NBP) anomalies, reflecting different respiration responses. We showed that regional responses combine in complicated ways to produce the observed CONUS responses. Because of the compensating effect of the carbonflux anomalies between northern and southern CONUS in 2011 and between spring and summer in 2012, the annual NBP decreased by 0.10 +/- 0.16 GtC in 2011, and increased by 0.10 +/- 0.16 GtC in 2012 over CONUS, consistent with previous reported results. Over the 2011 and 2012 drought-impacted regions, the reductions in NBP were similar to 40% of the regional annual fossil fuel emissions, underscoring the importance of quantifying natural carbon flux variability as part of an overall observing strategy. The NBP reductions over the 2011 and 2012 CONUS drought-impacted region were opposite to the global atmospheric CO2 growth rate anomaly, implying that global atmospheric CO2 growth rate is an offsetting effect between enhanced uptake and emission, and enhancing the understanding of regional carbon-cycle climate relationship is necessary to improve the projections of future climate.","2018-09","2020-10-01 03:36:23","2020-10-07 19:07:50","","","","9","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\NCU54ITW\Liu et al. - 2018 - Detecting drought impact on terrestrial biosphere .pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Andrews Experimental Forest of Oregon. We tested how DOC export was related to streamflow and legacies of wood on the forest floor three to five decades after harvest of old-growth forest in seven watersheds spanning the rain to snow elevation gradient. Three watersheds had old-growth forest and four had 30 to 50-year-old forest established after clearcutting of old-growth forest. Mean annual DOC flux in the watersheds was related to the biomass of forest floor wood, which was two or three times higher in watersheds with old-growth forest compared to young forest, and was inversely related to elevation, a measure of snowpack depth and duration. In contrast, fluxes of inorganic elements such as Si and Ca did not vary with harvest history or forest floor characteristics. Annual fluxes of DOC, Si, and Ca were linearly related to annual runoff, and annual volume-weighted concentrations of these ions declined by<0.6% with several-fold increases in annual runoff. Across all years, DOC concentrations peaked before the peak of the hydrograph in all watersheds, which we interpret as representing movement, likely via preferential and surficial flow, of organic materials mineralized and solubilized during the long dry summers in this ecosystem. DOC concentrations relative to stream flow exhibited clockwise hysteresis loops in each water year, also suggesting that soluble DOC produced in the dry summer is exported in the fall. DOC concentration differences between reference and harvested watersheds also peaked in late summer or early fall, suggesting that the source of the additional DOC from reference watersheds came from coarse woody debris that remains moist during the dry summers and that was significantly greater in watersheds with elevated DOC. Taken together, our results suggest that forest floor wood is a previously unappreciated control on the supply of DOC that can be exported, and runoff is a secondary control on total DOC flux to streams. The legacy of forest harvest on DOC flux can be observed for decades, as total ecosystem carbon stocks, especially coarse woody debris, may require centuries to develop after old-growth forest harvest.","2018-09","2020-10-01 03:36:23","2021-12-07 19:41:07","","299-315","","3","140","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\2JILESS5\Lajtha and Jones - 2018 - Forest harvest legacies control dissolved organic .pdf","","Management; Journal Article; Aquatic; Transfer; DOC; Oregon; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Woody encroachment and its potential impacts (e.g., livestock forage, wildlife habitat, hydrological cycling) have led to widespread brush management. Although woody plants may have substantial impacts on soils, uncertainty remains regarding woody encroachment and brush management influences on carbon (C) pools. Surface C pools (shallow soils and litter) may be particularly dynamic in response to encroachment and brush management. However, we have limited understanding of spatiotemporal patterns of surface C responses or how surface pools respond relative to aboveground C, litter, roots, and deep soil organic C. Spatial variability and lack of basic ecological data in woody-encroached dryland ecosystems present challenges to filling this data gap. We assessed the impact of western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) encroachment and removal on C pools in a semi-arid sagebrush ecosystem. We used spatially-intensive sampling to create sub-canopy estimates of surface soil C (0-10cm depth) and litter C pools that consider variation in tree size/age and sub-canopy location for live juniper and around stumps that were cut 7years prior to sampling. We coupled the present size distribution of junipers with extensive existing allometric information about juniper in this region to estimate how landscape-level C pools would change through time under future management and land cover scenarios. Juniper encroachment and removal leads to substantial changes in C pools. Best-fit models for surface soil and litter C included positive responses to shrub basal diameter and negative responses to increasing relative distance from the bole to dripline. Juniper removal led to a net loss of surface C as a function of large decreases in litter C and small increases in surface soil C. At the landscape scale, deep soil C was the largest C pool (77MgCha(-1)), with an apparent lack of sensitivity to management. Overall, encroachment led to substantial increases in C storage over time as juniper size increased (excluding deep soil C, ecosystem C pools increased from 13.5 to 30.2MgCha(-1) with transition from sagebrush-dominated to present encroachment levels). The largest pool of accumulation was juniper aboveground C, with important other pools including juniper roots, litter, and surface soil C. Woody encroachment and subsequent brush management can have substantive impacts on ecosystem C pools, although our data suggest the spatiotemporal patterns of surface C pools need to be properly accounted for to capture C pool responses. Our approach of coupling spatially-intensive surface C information with shrub distribution and allometric data is an effective method for characterizing ecosystem C pools, offering an opportunity for filling in knowledge gaps regarding woody encroachment and brush management impacts on local-to-regional ecosystem C pools.","2018-09","2020-10-01 03:36:23","2021-12-06 17:25:06","","373-388","","3","140","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\XFA55KJH\Throop and Lajtha - 2018 - Spatial and temporal changes in ecosystem carbon p.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Processes; Flux; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective was to use CQESTR, a process-based C model, and SOC data collected in 2004, 2008, and 2012 to predict the best management to increase SOC under changing climate in four cropping systems, which included continuous wheat under no tillage (W-W/NT), wheat and sorghum' sudangrass [Sorghum bicolor (L.)

Since future yields and climate are uncertain, 20 scenarios for each cropping system were simulated with four climate projections and five crop yield scenarios (current crop yields, and 10 or 30% greater or lesser yields). Measured and simulated SOC were significantly (p < 0.0001) correlated (r = 0.98) at all soil depths. Predicted SOC changes ranged from -12.03 to 2.56 Mg C ha(-1) in the 1-m soil depth for W-F/MP and W-W/NT, respectively, during the 2012 to 2052 predictive period. Only W-W/NT sequestered SOC at a rate of 0.06 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) under current crop yields and climate. Under climate change and yield scenarios, W-W/NT lost SOC except with a 30% wheat yield increase for 40 yr.

However, limitations of sampling techniques inhibit efforts to accurately characterize CO2 evasion from streams, and particularly headwater streams with steep gradients, complex morphologies, and challenging terrain. CO2 source dynamics coupled with turbulence conditions control gas transfer velocities of CO2 (k(CO2)) and therefore drive CO2 evasion. We present estimates of K-CO2 and CO2 evasion from a steep, turbulent headwater stream in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, collected using an automated in situ CO2 tracer technique. Gas transfer velocities scaled positively with discharge, with a median k(CO2) of 36.8 m/day and a range of 13.5 to 169 m/day. Gas transfer velocities were highest during high-flow events, with 84% of all CO2 emissions occurring when discharge was higher than Q50, the median discharge (92.6 L/s). Widely used models overestimated gas transfervelocities with a mean relative error of 24% but underestimated k600 values above 165 m/day. Our determinations of gas transfer velocities for a range of streamflow suggest that CO2 evasion may be higher than previously estimated from direct measurements or models, particularly during high-flow events. These findings illustrate the need for direct, frequent, in situ determinations of K-CO2 to accurately characterize CO2 evasion dynamics in steep headwater streams. Plain Language Summary Characterizing the global carbon cycle is crucial for many aspects of earth science. Inland waters, such as streams, rivers, lakes, and estuaries, play a major role in the carbon cycle by carrying carbon from the land into water bodies and processing it, such that much of the carbon that enters an inland water body is either stored in sediments or evades into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2), a potent greenhouse gas. Headwater streams are particularly active sites of CO2 evasion, but a lack of data and limited sampling techniques inhibit our ability to accurately estimate and characterize this important system. This study provides new data on CO2 evasion from a headwater stream and suggests that high streamflow events, such as storms, drive CO2 evasion. This study also outlines a new technique for measuring CO2 evasion from streams, which will allow researchers to collect high-quality data more frequently.","2018-07","2020-10-01 03:36:25","2020-10-07 22:39:49","","2183-2197","","7","123","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\HRH8BWQ4\McDowell and Johnson - 2018 - Gas Transfer Velocities Evaluated Using Carbon Dio.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Flux; Aquatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These changes will also affect soil organic matter decomposition and associated stocks of soil organic C (SOC), which have the potential to feed back to climate change and affect agroecosystem resiliency. This special section brings together multiple efforts to assess effects of climate change on SOC stocks around the globe in grassland, pasture, and crop agroecosystems under varying management practices. The overall goal of these efforts is to identify optimum practices to enhance SOC accumulation. In this article, we summarize the highlights of these papers and assess their broader implications for future research to enhance agroecosystem SOC accumulation and resiliency to climate change. Fourteen of the twenty contributions apply dynamic process-based models to assess climate and/or long-term management impacts on SOC stocks, and four papers use statistical SOC models across landscapes or regions. Also included are one meta-analysis and one long-term study. The models applied in this collection performed well when reliable input data were available, underlining the usefulness of modeling efforts to inform management decisions that enhance SOC stocks. Overall, the findings confirm that most agroecosystems have the potential to store SOC through improved management. However, this will be challenging, particularly for dryland agriculture, unless crop yield and crop biomass increase under projected climate change.","2018-08","2020-10-01 03:36:26","2020-10-06 22:37:12","","579-587","","4","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\W3VW65DD\Gollany and Venterea - 2018 - Measurements and Models to Identify Agroecosystem .pdf","","Journal Article; Soil; Agriculture; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Perennial grasses cultivated in zero-tillage management systems hold promise as sustainable agroecosystems. High-yielding tropical C-4 grasses often have extensive rooting systems, and the belowground processes of root turnover, aggregate formation, and mineral stabilization drove rapid C accumulation after cultivation in a recent study. We sought (i) to understand and constrain the size and responsiveness of dynamic, intermediate-cycling C pools contributing to the observed C accrual rates, and (ii) to simulate C stocks over time under the disturbance of elevated temperature using soil incubation at multiple temperatures and physical fractionation via density and sonication. Three-pool transfer modeling of soil incubations revealed small pools of readily available (i.e., days to months) microbial substrate that were responsive to temperature, time since cultivation, and inputs. Larger, kinetically slow-cycling pools were more indicative of long-term (i.e., years to decades) changes in C stock and strongly connected to measured changes in physical fractions. Combining the sensitivity of readily available microbial substrate with three-pool transfer modeling of the physical fractions over time since cultivation revealed that dynamic transfers of inputs occurred between the free organic and aggregate-protected fractions, and from these fractions to the mineral-associated dense fraction.

Forests have traditionally been viewed as robust carbon (C) sinks; however, extreme heat-waves, drought and wildfire have increased tree mortality, particularly in widespread semi-arid regions, which account for similar to 41% of Earth's land surface. Using a set of modeling experiments, we show that California grasslands are a more resilient C sink than forests in response to 21st century changes in climate, with implications for designing climate-smart Cap and Trade offset policies. The resilience of grasslands to rising temperatures, drought and fire, coupled with the preferential banking of C to belowground sinks, helps to preserve sequestered terrestrial C and prevent it from re-entering the atmosphere. In contrast, California forests appear unable to cope with unmitigated global changes in the climate, switching from substantial C sinks to C sources by at least the mid-21st century. These results highlight the inherent risk of relying on forest C offsets in the absence of management interventions to avoid substantial fire-driven C emissions. On the other hand, since grassland environments, including tree-sparse rangelands, appear more capable of maintaining C sinks in 21st century, such ecosystems should be considered as an alternative C offset to climate-vulnerable forests. The further development of climate-smart approaches in California's carbon marketplace could serve as an example to offset programs around the world, particularly those expanding into widespread arid and semi-arid regions.","2018-07","2020-10-01 03:36:26","2020-10-09 16:30:53","","","","7","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\BVARQ9YJ\Dass et al. - 2018 - Grasslands may be more reliable carbon sinks than .pdf","","Fire; Biomass; Journal Article; Flux; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evaluating how watersheds respond to disturbance requires understanding mechanisms that interact over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Simulation modeling is a powerful tool for bridging these scales; however, model projections are limited by uncertainties in the initial state of plant carbon and nitrogen stores. Watershed models typically use one of two methods to initialize these stores: spin-up to steady state or remote sensing with allometric relationships. Spin-up involves running a model until vegetation reaches equilibrium based on climate. This approach assumes that vegetation across the watershed has reached maturity and is of uniform age, which fails to account for landscape heterogeneity and non-steady-state conditions. By contrast, remote sensing, can provide data for initializing such conditions. However, methods for assimilating remote sensing into model simulations can also be problematic. They often rely on empirical allometric relationships between a single vegetation variable and modeled carbon and nitrogen stores. Because allometric relationships are species- and region-specific, they do not account for the effects of local resource limitation, which can influence carbon allocation (to leaves, stems, roots, etc.). To address this problem, we developed a new initialization approach using the catchment-scale ecohydrologic model RHESSys. The new approach merges the mechanistic stability of spin-up with the spatial fidelity of remote sensing. It uses remote sensing to define spatially explicit targets for one or several vegetation state variables, such as leaf area index, across a watershed. The model then simulates the growth of carbon and nitrogen stores until the defined targets are met for all locations. We evaluated this approach in a mixed pine-dominated watershed in central Idaho, and a chaparral-dominated watershed in southern California. In the pine-dominated watershed, model estimates of carbon, nitrogen, and water fluxes varied among methods, while the target-driven method increased correspondence between observed and modeled streamflow. In the chaparral watershed, where vegetation was more homogeneously aged, there were no major differences among methods. Thus, in heterogeneous, disturbance-prone watersheds, the target-driven approach shows potential for improving biogeochemical projections.","2018-07","2020-10-01 03:36:26","2020-10-06 23:38:32","","1197-1214","","5","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QX6ZHFNE\Hanan et al. - 2018 - Accounting for disturbance history in models usin.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; California; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, collecting wall-towall laser altimetry data at regional and global scales is cost prohibitive. As a result, studies employing lidar for large area estimation typically collect data via strip sampling, leaving large swaths of the forest unmeasured by the instrument. The goal of this research was to develop and examine the performance of a coregionalization modeling approach for combining field measurements, strip samples of airborne lidar and Landsat-based remote sensing products to predict aboveground biomass (AGB) in interior Alaska's Tanana Valley. The proposed modeling strategy facilitates mapping of AGB density across the domain. Additionally, the coregionalization framework allows for estimation of total AGB for arbitrary areal units within the study area a key advance to support diverse management objectives in interior Alaska. This research focuses on characterization of prediction uncertainty in the form of posterior predictive coverage intervals and standard deviations. Using the framework detailed here, it is possible to quantify estimation uncertainty for any spatial extent, ranging from point level predictions of AGB density to estimates of AGB stocks for the full domain. The lidar-informed coregionalization models consistently outperformed their counterpart lidar-free models in terms of point-level predictive performance and total (mean) AGB precision. Additionally, including a Landsat-derived forest cover covariate further improved precision in regions with lower lidar sampling intensity. Findings also demonstrate that model-based approaches not explicitly accounting for residual spatial dependence can grossly underestimate uncertainty, resulting in falsely precise estimates of AGB. The inferential capabilities of AGB posterior predictive distribution (PPD) products extend beyond simply mapping AGB density. We show how PPD products can provide insight regarding drivers of AGB heterogeneity in boreal forests, including permafrost and fire, highlighting the range of potential applications for Bayesian geostatistical methods to integrate field, airborne and satellite data.","2018-06","2020-10-01 03:36:27","2020-10-01 21:48:07","","212-230","","","212","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\J698VNPM\Babcock et al. - 2018 - Geostatistical estimation of forest biomass in int.pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Pools; Journal Article; Alaska","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, treatment implementation has been slow and spatially limited relative to the extent of the area affected by fire suppression. Using model simulations, we quantified how large-scale restoration treatments in frequent-fire forest types would influence C outcomes in the Sierra Nevada mountain range under projected climate-wildfire interactions. Our results indicate that large-scale restoration treatments are an effective means of reducing fire hazard and increasing C storage and stability under future climate and wildfire conditions. The effects of implementation timing suggest that accelerated implementation of large-scale restoration treatments may confer greater C-storage benefits, supporting California's efforts to combat climate change.","2018-05","2020-10-01 03:36:28","2021-12-07 19:45:09","","207-212","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\LI3NSCNH\Liang et al. - 2018 - Large-scale restoration increases carbon stability.pdf","","Fire; Management; Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; California; Silviculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of the three coastal wetland types: tidal marshes, tidal forests, and seagrass meadows, carbon burial by seagrasses is relatively under-studied, and reported rates range widely from 45 to 190 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Additionally, most of these seagrass rates are biased toward tropical and subtropical species, particularly Posidonia oceanica, with few focused on Zostera marina, the most widespread species in the northern hemisphere. We measured sediment organic content, carbon content, and long-term accretion rates to estimate organic carbon stocks and sequestration rates for a Z. marina meadow in Padilla Bay, a National Estuarine Research Reserve in Washington. We found rates of carbon sequestration to be quite low relative to commonly reported values, averaging 9 to 11 g C m(-2) yr(-1). We attribute this to both low sediment organic content and low rates of accretion. We postulate here that Padilla Bay's low carbon sequestration capacity may be representative of healthy Z. marina meadows rather than an anomaly, and that Z. marina meadows have an inherently low carbon sequestration capacity because of the species' low tolerance for suspended sediment (which limits light availability) and sediment organic content (which leads to toxic sulfide levels). Further research should focus on measuring carbon sequestration rates from other Z. marina meadows, particularly from sites that exhibit, a priori, the potential for higher rates of carbon sequestration.","2018-05","2020-10-01 03:36:28","2021-12-07 16:22:57","","80-91","","2","92","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\EAY5GDIK\Poppe and Rybczyk - 2018 - Carbon Sequestration in a Pacific Northwest Eelgra.pdf","","Wetlands; Journal Article; Sequestration; Soil; Aquatic; Washington","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Soil was sampled at an intensively managed Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) plantation in north-western Oregon, USA. Management regimes thinning, fertilization plus thinning, and no (control) treatment were randomly assigned to nine 0.2-ha plots established in 1989 in a juvenile stand. Prior to harvest, forest floor and soil bulk density and chemical analysis samples were collected by depth to 150 cm. During a single rotation of similar to 40 years, thinning treatments significantly reduced SOC and N stocks by 25% and 27%, respectively, compared to no treatment. Most of this loss occurred in deeper soil layers (below similar to 20 cm). Fertilization plus thinning treatments also reduced SOC and N stocks, but not significantly. Across all management regimes, deeper soil layers comprised the majority of SOC and N stocks.

Here we directly quantify this response on inter-annual timescales by building a linear regression of inter-annual NEE anomalies against observed air temperature anomalies into an atmospheric inverse calculation based on long-term atmospheric CO2 observations. This allows us to estimate the sensitivity of NEE to inter-annual variations in temperature (seen as a climate proxy) resolved in space and with season. As this sensitivity comprises both direct temperature effects and the effects of other climate variables co-varying with temperature, we interpret it as “inter-annual climate sensitivity”. We find distinct seasonal patterns of this sensitivity in the northern extratropics that are consistent with the expected seasonal responses of photosynthesis, respiration, and fire. Within uncertainties, these sensitivity patterns are consistent with independent inferences from eddy covariance data. On large spatial scales, northern extratropical and tropical interannual NEE variations inferred from the NEE-T regression are very similar to the estimates of an atmospheric inversion with explicit inter-annual degrees of freedom. The results of this study offer a way to benchmark ecosystem process models in more detail than existing effective global climate sensitivities.

While land change impacts on ecosystem carbon dynamics have been the focus of numerous studies, few efforts have been based on observational data incorporating multiple ecosystem types spanning large geographic areas over long time horizons. In this study we use a variety of synoptic-scale remote sensing data to estimate the effect of LULC changes associated with urbanization, agricultural expansion and contraction, forest harvest, and wildfire on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems (forest, grasslands, shrublands, and agriculture) in the conterminous United States (i.e. excluding Alaska and Hawaii) between 1973 and 2010. We estimate large net declines in the area of agriculture and forest, along with relatively small increases in grasslands and shrublands. The largest net change in any class was an estimated gain of 114 865 km(2) of developed lands, an average rate of 3282 km(2) yr(-1). On average, US ecosystems sequestered carbon at an annual rate of 254 Tg C yr(-1). In forest lands, the net sink declined by 35% over the study period, largely a result of land-use legacy, increasing disturbances, and reductions in forest area due to land use conversion. Uncertainty in LULC change data contributed to a similar to 16% margin of error in the annual carbon sink estimate prior to 1985 (approximately +/- 40 Tg C yr(-1)). Improvements in LULC and disturbance mapping starting in the mid-1980s reduced this uncertainty by similar to 50% after 1985. We conclude that changes in LULC are a critical component to understanding ecosystem carbon dynamics, and continued improvements in detection, quantification, and attribution of change have the potential to significantly reduce current uncertainties.","2018-04","2020-10-01 03:36:29","2020-10-09 18:35:36","","","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\VBPRE998\Sleeter et al. - 2018 - Effects of contemporary land-use and land-cover ch.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Land use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, this study examines what objectives are prioritized by stakeholders and Indigenous Peoples when discussing forest carbon mitigation in BC's forests, as well as the perceived effectiveness of, and levels of support for, six forest-based carbon mitigation strategies. We start by describing the methodological framework involving two series of workshops. We then describe the results from the first round of workshops where participants identified 11 objectives that can be classified into four categories: biophysical, economic, social, and procedural. Afterwards, we discuss the second series of workshops, which allowed participants to evaluate six climate change mitigation strategies against the objectives previously identified, and highlight geographical differences, if any, between BC's coastal and interior regions. Our results effectively illustrate the potential and efficacy of our novel methodology in informing a variety of stakeholders in different regions, and generating consistent results with a surprising degree of consensus on both key objectives and preference for mitigation alternatives.

To isolate the effects of model structural uncertainty on the global distribution of soil carbon stocks and turnover times we developed a soil biogeochemical testbed that forces three different soil models with consistent climate and plant productivity inputs. The models tested here include a first-order, microbial implicit approach (CASA-CNP), and two recently developed microbially explicit models that can be run at global scales (MIMICS and CORPSE). When forced with common environmental drivers, the soil models generated similar estimates of initial soil carbon stocks (roughly 1,400Pg C globally, 0-100cm), but each model shows a different functional relationship between mean annual temperature and inferred turnover times. Subsequently, the models made divergent projections about the fate of these soil carbon stocks over the 20(th) century, with models either gaining or losing over 20 Pg C globally between 1901 and 2010. Single-forcing experiments with changed inputs, temperature, and moisture suggest that uncertainty associated with freeze-thaw processes as well as soil textural effects on soil carbon stabilization were larger than direct temperature uncertainties among models. Finally, the models generated distinct projections about the timing and magnitude of seasonal heterotrophic respiration rates, again reflecting structural uncertainties that were related to environmental sensitivities and assumptions about physicochemical stabilization of soil organic matter. By providing a computationally tractable and numerically consistent framework to evaluate models we aim to better understand uncertainties among models and generate insights about factors regulating the turnover of soil organic matter.","2018-04","2020-10-01 03:36:29","2020-10-14 15:49:53","","1563-1579","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\XBA5R27G\Wieder et al. - 2018 - Carbon cycle confidence and uncertainty Exploring.pdf","","Carbon Cycle; Modeling; Journal Article; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The PROFILES table also contains data, when reported by the source, for percent carbonate carbon, pH, percent total nitrogen, particle size distribution (percent sand, silt, clay), texture class, exchangeable cations, cation and total exchange capacity, and percent Fe and Al. An additional table provides references (REFERENCES table) for the source data. Earlier versions of the database were used to develop national soil carbon modeling categories based on differences in carbon stocks linked to soil taxonomy and to examine the potential of using soil taxonomy and leading tree species to improve accuracy in modeled predictions. The current database is being used to develop soil carbon model parameters linked to soil taxonomy and leading tree species and, by various governmental and nongovernmental organizations, to improve digital mapping of ecosite types and soil properties regionally, nationally, and internationally.

We considered four cropland management practices-biochar, compost, cover crops, and no-till-and two rangeland management practices, compost and high-impact grazing. Results across all management practices reveal underlying uncertainties as well as very modest opportunities for soil carbon management to contribute meaningfully to California's climate mitigation.

The connectivity of runoff source areas during both baseflow and stormflow conditions and their combined influence on biogeochemical fluxes remain poorly understood. Here we focused on a set of 3.3 and 48.4 ha nested watersheds (North Carolina, USA). These watersheds comprise ephemeral and intermittent runoff-producing headwaters and perennial runoff-producing lowlands. Within these landscape elements, we characterized the timing and magnitude of precipitation, runoff, and runoff-generating flow paths. The active surface drainage network (ASDN) reflected connectivity to, and contributions from, source areas that differed under baseflow and stormflow conditions. The baseflow-associated ASDN expanded and contracted seasonally, driven by the rise and fall of the seasonal water table. Superimposed on this were event-activated source area contributions driven by connectivity to surficial and shallow subsurface flow paths. Frequently activated shallow flow paths also caused increased in-stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations with increases in runoff across both watershed scales. The spread and variability within this DOC-runoff relationship was driven by a seasonal depletion of DOC from continual shallow subsurface flow path activation and subsequent replenishment from autumn litterfall. Our findings suggest that hydrobiogeochemical signals at larger watershed outlets can be driven by the expansion, contraction, and connection of lateral, longitudinal, and vertical source areas with distinct runoff generation processes.","2018-03","2020-10-01 03:36:30","2020-10-14 16:46:47","","1576-1598","","3","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\UTZWAMJV\Zimmer and McGlynn - 2018 - Lateral, Vertical, and Longitudinal Source Area Co.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Aquatic; Transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A comprehensive assessment of the economic rationale for stumping is largely absent. This study attempts to fill this gap by using a detailed case study of a 46-year old trial and an assessment using growth and yield model simulations of a range of managed Douglas-fir stands in the southern interior of BC. The analysis considers both timber and carbon values over a variety of management costs and site conditions. There are conditions within which stumping is an economically viable strategy, especially on public forestlands, that will improve long-term timber yields and storage of carbon on the land base. Specifically, we find stumping at the Skimikin site increases annual stand productivity by 3.29 m(3)/ha/yr at age 44. Under reasonable economic conditions and an interest rate of 3%, this productivity growth leads to a minimum average increase in the soil expectation value (SEV) of $1105/ha. If carbon ($15/t CO2) is included in the calculations, the increase is a minimum increase of $2586/ha. We find that with carbon, and under similar economic conditions and discount rate, stumping is more profitable than not stumping on even less productive sites than Skimikin. On stands with productivity of 20 mat age 50 years (SI20), we find stumping generates at least $141/ha more than unstumped stands.","2018-02-01","2020-10-01 03:36:32","2020-10-05 16:45:19","","129-147","","","409","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\XQCRZYFY\Bogdanski et al. - 2018 - Stumping out tree root disease - An economic analy.pdf","","Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Economics; British Columbia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, biomass monitoring strategies must characterize both the biomass of the forests at a given point in time and the dynamic processes that change it. Here, we describe and test an empirical monitoring system designed to meet those needs. Our system uses a mix of field data, statistical modeling, remotely-sensed time-series imagery, and small-footprint lidar data to build and evaluate maps of forest biomass. It ascribes biomass change to specific change agents, and attempts to capture the impact of uncertainty in methodology. We find that: A common image framework for biomass estimation and for change detection allows for consistent comparison of both state and change processes controlling biomass dynamics. Regional estimates of total biomass agree well with those from plot data alone. The system tracks biomass densities up to 450-500 Mg ha(-1) with little bias, but begins underestimating true biomass as densities increase further. Scale considerations are important. Estimates at the 30 m grain size are noisy, but agreement at broad scales is good. Further investigation to determine the appropriate scales is underway. Uncertainty from methodological choices is evident, but much smaller than uncertainty based on choice of allometric equation used to estimate biomass from tree data. In this forest-dominated study area, growth and loss processes largely balance in most years, with loss processes dominated by human removal through harvest. In years with substantial fire activity, however, overall biomass loss greatly outpaces growth. Taken together, our methods represent a unique combination of elements foundational to an operational landscape-scale forest biomass monitoring program.","2018-02","2020-10-01 03:36:32","2020-10-07 17:47:31","","","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\IHDYXNB4\Kennedy et al. - 2018 - An empirical, integrated forest biomass monitoring.pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Journal Article; California; Oregon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mapping of 113 large wildfires using Landsat satellite images from before and after 2015 indicated that nearly 60% of this area was burned at moderateto-high severity levels. Field measurements near the town of Tanana on the Yukon River were carried out in July of 2017 in both unburned and 2015 burned forested areas (nearly adjacent to one-another) to visually verify locations of different Landsat burn severity classes (low, moderate, or high; LBS, MBS, HBS). Results: Field measurements indicated that the loss of surface organic layers in boreal ecosystem fires is a major factor determining post-fire soil temperature changes, depth of thawing, and carbon losses from the mineral topsoil layer. Measurements in forest sites showed that soil temperature profiles to 30 cm depth at burned forest sites were higher by an average of 8-10 degrees C compared to unburned forest sites. Sampling and laboratory analysis indicated a 65% reduction in soil carbon content and a 58% reduction in soil nitrogen content in severely burned sample sites compared to soil mineral samples from nearby unburned spruce forests. Conclusions: Combined with nearly unprecedented forest areas severely burned in the Interior region of Alaska in 2015, total ecosystem fire-related losses of carbon to the atmosphere exceeded most previous estimates for the state, owing mainly to inclusion of potential “mass wasting” and decomposition in the mineral soil carbon layer in the 2 years following these forest fires.","2018-01-08","2020-10-01 03:36:32","2020-10-08 16:40:10","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QLKSDMMT\Potter - 2018 - Ecosystem carbon emissions from 2015 forest fires .pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; Alaska; Flux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is the basic building block of biology, and by trapping radiation it also plays an important role in maintaining the Earth's atmosphere at a temperature hospitable to life. Like all matter, carbon can neither be created nor destroyed, but instead is continuously exchanged between ecosystems and the environment through a complex combination of physics and biology. In recent decades, these exchanges have led to an increased accumulation of carbon on the land surface: the terrestrial carbon sink. Over the past 10 years (2007-2016) the sink has removed an estimated 3.61 Pg C year -1 from the atmosphere, which amounts to 33.7% of total anthropogenic emissions from industrial activity and land-use change. This sink constitutes a valuable ecosystem service, which has significantly slowed the rate of climate change. Here, we review current understanding of the underlying biological processes that govern the terrestrial carbon sink and their dependence on climate, atmospheric composition, and human interventions.","2018","2020-10-01 03:36:33","2020-10-07 17:52:54","","219-243","","","43","","","","Annual Review of Environment and Resources","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 1543-5938 DOI: 10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-030204","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\BE882CUV\Keenan and Williams - 2018 - The Terrestrial Carbon Sink.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux","","Gadgil, A and Tomich, TP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, most soil models use conceptual rather than measurable SOC pools. What would the traditional pool-based soil model look like if it were built today, reflecting the latest understanding of biological, chemical, and physical transformations in soils? We propose a conceptual model-the Millennial model-that defines pools as measurable entities. First, we discuss relevant pool definitions conceptually and in terms of the measurements that can be used to quantify pool size, formation, and destabilization. Then, we develop a numerical model following the Millennial model conceptual framework to evaluate against the Century model, a widely-used standard for estimating SOC stocks across space and through time. The Millennial model predicts qualitatively similar changes in total SOC in response to single factor perturbations when compared to Century, but different responses to multiple factor perturbations. We review important conceptual and behavioral differences between the Millennial and Century modeling approaches, and the field and lab measurements needed to constrain parameter values. We propose the Millennial model as a simple but comprehensive framework to model SOC pools and guide measurements for further model development.","2018-01","2020-10-01 03:36:33","2020-10-01 16:04:41","","51-71","","1-2","137","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\5BE7H3U7\Abramoff et al. - 2018 - The Millennial model in search of measurable pool.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For regular monitoring of large areas, wall-to-wall ALS data is economically prohibitive. However, when data are acquired in a strip-sampling mode, ALS can support the estimation of forest resources on large areas such as counties, states, and nations. This study investigated the combined use of ALS data acquired along parallel strips and co-located field observations of live and standing dead trees to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) at regional and sub-regional levels. The study area comprised the Tanana Inventory Unit (TIU) (138,566 km(2)), located in interior Alaska, and four sub-regions (106-7282 km(2)) within the TIU. The field data consisted of 1676 ground observations from six independent field campaigns. Ninety-four plots came from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the USDA Forest Service. The FIA plots, each consisting of four 1/60 ha subplots, were acquired using a probabilistic sampling design. The remaining ground observations were collected during field inventories across TIU, and consisted of 335 independent field plots and 257 clusters containing up to four plots each. The estimation procedure followed a two-phase sampling design grounded within a hybrid inferential framework, which combines design-based estimation for the first phase and model-based inference in the second phase. Post-stratified estimation by land cover class indicated that the hybrid estimation obtained 11-55% better precision compared to direct (design based) estimation based solely on field observations. When the field sample sizes were reduced to 25%, the standard errors for the hybrid estimation increased by 3 to 5 pp. Direct and hybrid estimates were compared for two sub-regions, and the hybrid estimated AGBs were 6.4% and 13.3% larger than the direct estimates. On both these study sub-regions, the 95% confidence interval of the hybrid estimated mean AGB included the direct estimate of the mean and vice versa.","2018-01","2020-10-01 03:36:33","2020-10-06 17:44:16","","741-755","","","204","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\HA5SLVH7\Ene et al. - 2018 - Large-area hybrid estimation of aboveground biomas.pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Journal Article; Alaska","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty site-years of carbon and water fluxes covering a large precipitation gradient and a variety of crop species and management practices were measured in the inland Pacific Northwest using the eddy covariance method. The rain-fed fields were net carbon sinks, while the irrigated site was close to carbon neutral during the winter wheat crop years. Sites growing spring crops were either carbon sinks, sources, or neutral, varying with crops, rainfall zones, and tillage practices. Fluxes were more sensitive to variability in precipitation than temperature: annual carbon and water fluxes increased with the increasing precipitation while only respiration increased with temperature in the high-rainfall area. Compared to a nearby rain-fed site, irrigation improved winter wheat production but resulted in large losses of carbon and water to the atmosphere. Compared to conventional tillage, no-till had significantly lower respiration but resulted in slightly lower yields and water use efficiency over 4 years. Under future climate change, it is expected that more carbon fixation by crops and evapotranspiration would occur in a warmer and wetter environment.","2017-12","2020-10-01 03:36:34","2020-10-05 18:50:21","","3142-3160","","12","122","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\CVVSGK3D\Chi et al. - 2017 - Effects of Climatic Conditions and Management Prac.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Washington; Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A deep understanding of terrestrial feedbacks to such effects and recovery mechanisms in forests across contrasting climatic regimes is essential to predict future regional/global C and water budgets, which are also closely related to the potential forest management decisions. However, the resilience of multi-aged and even-aged forests to disturbances has been debated for >60 years because of technical measurement constraints. Here we evaluated 62 site-years of eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem production (NEP), evapotranspiration (ET), the estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R-e) and ecosystem-level WUE, as well as the relationships with environmental controls in three chronosequences of multi- and even-aged coniferous forests covering the Mediterranean, temperate and boreal regions. Age-specific dynamics in multi-year mean annual NEP and WUE revealed that forest age is a key variable that determines the sign and magnitude of recovering forest C source-sink strength from disturbances. However, the trends of annual NEP and WUE across succession stages between two stand structures differed substantially. The successional patterns of NEP exhibited an inverted-U trend with age at the two even-aged chronosequences, whereas NEP of the multi-aged chronosequence increased steadily through time. Meanwhile, site-level WUE of even-aged forests decreased gradually from young to mature, whereas an apparent increase occurred for the same forest age in multi-aged stands. Compared with even-aged forests, multi-aged forests sequestered more CO2 with forest age and maintained a relatively higher WUE in the later succession periods. With regard to the available flux measurements in this study, these behaviors are independent of tree species, stand ages and climate conditions. We also found that distinctly different environmental factors controlled forest C and water fluxes under three climatic regimes. Typical weather events such as temperature anomalies or drying-wetting cycles severely affected forest functions. Particularly, a summer drought in the boreal forest resulted in an increased NEP owing to a considerable decrease in R-e, but at the cost of greater water loss from deeper groundwater resources. These findings will provide important implications for forest management strategies to mitigate global climate change. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The spatial distribution of this carbon influences climate and wetland policy. To assist with international accords such as the Paris Climate Agreement, national-level assessments such as the United States (U.S.) National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, and regional, state, local, and project-level evaluation of CO2 sequestration credits, we developed a geodatabase (CoBluCarb) and high-resolution maps of soil organic carbon (SOC) distribution by linking National Wetlands Inventory data with the U.S. Soil Survey Geographic Database. For over 600,000 wetlands, the total carbon stock and organic carbon density was calculated at 5-cm vertical resolution from 0 to 300 cm of depth. Across the continental United States, there are 1,153-1,359 Tg of SOC in the upper 0-100 cm of soils across a total of 24945.9 km(2) of tidal wetland area, twice as much carbon as the most recent national estimate. Approximately 75% of this carbon was found in estuarine emergent wetlands with freshwater tidal wetlands holding about 19%. The greatest pool of SOC was found within the Atchafalaya/Vermilion Bay complex in Louisiana, containing about 10% of the U.S. total. The average density across all tidal wetlands was 0.071 g cm(-3) across 0-15 cm, 0.055 g cm(-3) across 0-100 cm, and 0.040 g cm(-3) at the 100 cm depth. There is inherent variability between and within individual wetlands; however, we conclude that it is possible to use standardized values at a range of 0-100 cm of the soil profile, to provide first-order quantification and to evaluate future changes in carbon stocks in response to environmental perturbations. This Tier 2-oriented carbon stock assessment provides a scientific method that can be copied by other nations in support of international requirements.","2017-12","2020-10-01 03:36:34","2021-12-07 16:12:43","","5468-5480","","12","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\7D2LH9GR\Hinson et al. - 2017 - The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon in.pdf","","Wetlands; Pools; Journal Article; Soil; Aquatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additional participation could benefit both the market and non-industrial private forest landowners. We developed a mail questionnaire which served as both a survey instrument and outreach tool about the market. Questions covered forest ownership objectives, landowners' future plans for forests, views of climate change, and attitudes and intentions regarding forest carbon offset project development. We sampled from five Northern California counties for a total of 143 usable surveys. Three different groups of landowners were identified based on their management objectives: amenity (including protecting nature and recreation); legacy (passing land to children and/or maintaining a farm or ranch); and income. Landowner objective groups differed on several key variables, particularly related to potential motivations for joining the market, while all landowners expressed concerns about protocol requirements. Regardless of ownership objectives, over half expressed that receiving revenue from their forests would be an important motivator to join, though most were unwilling to satisfy protocol requirements, even after learning of the potential benefits of program participation. Thus, participation appears to be limited by the costly and complex project development process, as well as a lack of landowner awareness. Extending these lessons, we assert that different landowners may approach payment for ecosystem services programs with different needs, awareness, and motivations, which provide important lessons for those who conduct landowner outreach and for PES program designers.","2017-11","2020-10-01 03:36:34","2020-10-07 17:38:11","","882-895","","5","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\L956KF44\Kelly et al. - 2017 - The Willingness of Non-Industrial Private Forest O.pdf","","Journal Article; California; Economics; Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although this has been well documented, the longevity of these shifts has not. Presented is a case study of a single 200-ha burn to begin to understand how long plant communities and biomass production remain diverged between burned and unburned annual grass rangeland. Species composition and biomass production were monitored before and for 3 yr after burning. Burning drastically reduced medusahead (Taeniatherum caputmedusae; P < 0.01) the following year from 69% in the control to 4% cover in the area burned. In the same year, filaree (Erodium spp.; P < 0.01) filled in the area left vacant, subsequently lessening production (P < 0.01) in the burn area by over half that of the control. No difference existed in the occurrence of native wildflower species due to fire. Three consecutive drought years following the burn shifted the control from medusahead dominance to filaree in a linear fashion. At the same time, in the burned area medusahead cover increased fourfold between 1 and 3 yr after the burn. By 3 yr post burning, the area had 4% more medusahead cover than the control and was equal in filaree, rose clover (Trifoliumhirtum), and soft brome(Bromus hordeaceus) cover. Our results suggest that a controlled burn followed by drought can cause the divergence in species composition and production to become void in as little as 3 yr after a well-timed burn in a low-elevation annual grass rangeland system.","2017-11","2020-10-01 03:36:34","2021-03-10 01:25:37","","755-758","","6","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\V4HIDX3B\Davy and Dykier - 2017 - Longevity of a Controlled Burn's Impacts on Specie.pdf","","Fire; Management; Biomass; Journal Article; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The combined effects of soil compaction (none, moderate, severe), organic matter removal (tree bole only, whole tree, whole tree plus forest floor), and competing vegetation control (complete: VC, none: NVC) on aboveground bio-mass were tested. Soils ranged from sandy loams to clay loams and were compacted (10-25% bulk density increase) prior to planting of mixed-conifer seedlings. Soil compaction resulted in a 15% increase in planted tree biomass on a plot-scale basis, attributed to improved seedling survival, along with reduced competing vegetation biomass on NVC plots. The unexpected response of tree growth to compaction was consistent across the LTSP sites. After year 5, there were no differences among the diverse organic matter treatments in tree biomass, periodic annual increment, or competing vegetation biomass. In contrast, vegetation control had a strong positive effect on tree biomass, about 68% greater tree growth (129.13 Mg ha(-1)) compared to trees grown on NVC plots (76.83 Mg ha(-1)). However, total vegetation biomass (trees + competing vegetation) was greater without vegetation control for the initial 10 years of the study, prior to canopy closure. The results showed near-complete tolerance by forest biomass to soil compaction and surface organic matter manipulation on LTSP plantations across a wide geographic range in California.

Microbial communities play an integral role in soil biogeochemical cycles; knowledge about microbial composition helps provide a mechanistic understanding of these ecosystem-level phenomena. Next generation sequencing approaches were used to investigate changes in microbial functional groups during ecosystem development, in response to climate change, in northern boreal wetlands. A gradient of wetlands that developed following permafrost degradation was used to characterize changes in the soil microbial communities that mediate C cycling: a bog representing an “undisturbed” system with intact permafrost, and a younger bog and an older bog that formed following the disturbance of permafrost thaw. Reference 16S rRNA databases and several diversity indices were used to assess structural differences among these communities, to assess relationships between soil microbial community composition and various environmental variables including redox potential and pH. Rates of potential CO2 and CH4 gas production were quantified to correlate sequence data with gas flux. The abundance of organic C degraders was highest in the youngest bog, suggesting higher rates of microbial processes, including potential CH4 production. In addition, alpha diversity was also highest in the youngest bog, which seemed to be related to a more neutral pH and a lower redox potential. These results could potentially be driven by increased niche differentiation in anaerobic soils. These results suggest that ecosystem structure, which was largely driven by changes in edaphic and plant community characteristics between the “undisturbed” permafrost bog and the two bogs formed following permafrost thaw, strongly influenced microbial function.

Therefore, understanding how fire characteristics influence PyC stocks is vital, particularly in the context of California forests for which an increase of high-severity fires is predicted over the next decades. We measured forest C and persistent PyC stocks in areas burned by low-to-moderate and high-severity fire, as well as in adjacent unburned areas in a California mixed-conifer forest, 2 to 3years after wildfire. We measured C and PyC stocks in the following compartments: standing trees, downed wood, forest floor, and mineral soil (0-5cm), and we identified PyC using the weak nitric acid digestion method. We found that the total stock of PyC did not differ among fire severity classes (overall mean 24830gCm(-2)); however, fire severity influenced the distribution of PyC in the individual compartments. Areas burned by high-severity fire had 2.5 times more PyC stocked in the coarse woody debris (p<0.05), 3.3 times more PyC stocked in standing trees (p<0.05), and a lower PyC stock in the forest floor (-22%, p<0.05) compared to low-to-moderate fire severity areas. These results have important implications for the permanence time of PyC, which is putatively higher in standing trees and coarse woody debris compared to the forest floor, where it is susceptible to rapid losses through erosion. Plain Language Summary Charcoal (i.e., pyrogenic carbon) is an important form of carbon present in forest soil subject to fire events that is characterized by a high resistance to decomposition and thus may remain in soil for hundreds of years before it is transformed into carbon dioxide (an important green house gas). However, charcoal production is so far not considered when assessing the impact of forest fires on green house gas production. It is possible that due to this neglection the impact of forest fires on the carbon cycle is currently overestimated. Here we quantified charcoal production during forest fires in a forest burned by fires of different severity. We found that fire severity does not alter the amount of charcoal created, whereas it influences the distribution in the forest compartments (forest floor versus trees). Our results have important implications for the residence time of charcoal in the terrestrial ecosystems, because charcoal is expected to stay longer in standing trees and coarse woody debris compared to the forest floor, where it is susceptible to rapid losses through erosion.","2017-09","2020-10-01 03:36:35","2021-12-07 19:10:23","","2338-2355","","9","122","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\P7CGWEPS\Maestrini et al. - 2017 - Fire severity alters the distribution of pyrogenic.pdf","","Fire; Pools; Journal Article; California; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we develop a parsimonious, modular C and N cycle model, the Dual Arrhenius Michaelis-Menten-Microbial Carbon and Nitrogen Phyisology (DAMM-MCNiP), that generates testable hypotheses regarding the effect of temperature, moisture, and substrate supply on C and N cycling. We compared this model to DAMM alone and an empirical model of heterotrophic respiration based on Harvard Forest data. We show that while different model structures explain similar amounts of variation in respiration, they differ in their ability to infer processes that affect C flux. We applied DAMM-MCNiP to explain an observed seasonal hysteresis in the relationship between respiration and temperature and show using an exudation simulation that the strength of the priming effect depended on the stoichiometry of the inputs. Low C:N inputs stimulated priming of soil organic matter decomposition, but high C:N inputs were preferentially utilized by microbes as a C source with limited priming. The simplicity of DAMM-MCNiP's simultaneous representations of temperature, moisture, substrate supply, enzyme activity, and microbial growth processes is unique among microbial physiology models and is sufficiently parsimonious that it could be incorporated into larger-scale models of C and N cycling. Plain Language Summary Microorganisms that grow in the soil, like bacteria and fungi, affect how much carbon resides in the soil and how much is released to the atmosphere as CO2. Mathematical models used to make climate change predictions often struggle to capture the activity of soil microbes in realistic ways. This study uses well-established descriptions of water and temperature effects on soil microbes to predict rate of carbon and nitrogen cycling in the soil. Our new model reproduces the changing relationship between temperature and microbial respiration during the growing season. We also show using a theoretical addition of root secretions that the microbial response depends on the nitrogen content of the added plant material. This model is simple and based on well defined physical and biological properties, and could be developed to model microbial activity at larger scales.","2017-09","2020-10-01 03:36:35","2020-10-01 16:04:41","","2418-2434","","9","122","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\7WNGSHEK\Abramoff et al. - 2017 - A parsimonious modular approach to building a mech.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, changes in SOM stocks in response to agronomic practices are slow and show years later when it is too late for adjustments in management. Identifying early indicators of SOM dynamics will allow early management decisions and quick remedial action. The objectives of this study were to evaluate long-term effects of tillage intensity and timing on SOM pools and determine the most responsive SOM pools to tillage practice. Soil from a long-term (53 years) winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-spring pea (Pisum sativum L.) rotation and undisturbed grass pasture (GP) in inland Pacific Northwest (iPNW) was sampled to evaluate the effect of four tillage systems [no-till (NT), disk/chisel (DT/CT), spring plow (SP), and fall plow (FP)] on soil organic carbon (SOC, proxy for SOM), total nitrogen (TN), particulate organic matter carbon (POM-C) and nitrogen (POM-N), permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC), water extractable organic carbon (WEOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), KCl-extractable nitrogen (KEN), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), basal respiration (BR), carbon mineralization (Cmin), andmetabolic quotient (qCO(2)). GP had higher levels of SOC pools than cultivated treatments. On average, tillage significantly decreased SOC and TN by 28 and 26%, respectively, compared to GP. Among the cultivated soils, tillage had no significant effect on SOC and TN, except for DT/CT that had slightly higher SOC than FP (P = 0.08). On the contrary, NT and DT/CT significantly (P < 0.05) increased levels of POM-C, POM-N, POXC, WEOC, MBC, BR, Cmin, and qCO(2) over FP or SP. However, tillage did not affect TDN, MBN, and KEN. The C-pools (POM-C, POXC, MBC, WEOC, BR, and Cmin) were more strongly correlated with SOM than the N-pools (TDN, MBN, and KEN), with an exception to POM-N. Under wheat-pea rotation in the iPNW, reduced tillage systems (NT and DT/CT) have a potential to maintain or increase SOM, which can be assessed early through its physical (POM), chemical (POXC, WEOC), and microbiological (MBC, BR, Cmin) indicators. POXC and WEOC were the most sensitive indicators of tillage-induced changes in SOM dynamics.","2017-08-15","2020-10-01 03:36:36","2020-10-01 21:48:07","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\XLYHKIH9\Awale et al. - 2017 - Soil Organic Carbon Pools as Early Indicators for .pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Soil; Oregon; Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study assesses direct environmental impacts along with substitution effects from displacing fossil fuels and managed forest wood sourcing activities. Follow-on effects on forest carbon stocks, land use, and fuel markets are not assessed. Sensitivity analysis addresses landfill carbon storage and biodegradation rates, atmospheric emissions controls, displaced fuel types, and two alternative carbon accounting methods commonly used for waste management LCAs. Base-case carbon accounting considers emissions and uptakes of all biogenic and fossil carbon compounds, including biogenic carbon dioxide. Base-case results show that recycling options (recycling into reconstituted wood products or into wood pulp for papermaking) rank better than all burning or burying options for overall monetized score as well as for climate impacts, except that wood substitution for coal in industrial boilers is slightly better than recycling for the climate. Wood substitution for natural gas boiler fuel has the highest environmental impacts. Sensitivity analysis shows the overall monetized score rankings for recycling options to be robust except for the carbon accounting method, for which all options are highly sensitive. Under one of the alternative methods, wood substitution for coal boiler fuel and landfill options with high methane capture efficiency are the best for the overall score; recycling options are next to the worst. Under the other accounting alternative, wood substitution for coal and waste-to-energy are the best, followed by recycling options.","2017-08","2020-10-01 03:36:36","2021-12-07 18:51:50","","844-856","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\VBTFCYUR\Morris - 2017 - Recycle, Bury, or Burn Wood Waste Biomass LCA Ans.pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; Life Cycle; Wood products; Fuel wood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To simulate forest C dynamics, data was input into a spatially-explicit version of the Carbon Budget Model-Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3). Transfers of terrestrial C to inland aquatic environments need to be considered to better capture the watershed scale C balance. Using dissolved organic C (DOC) and stream flow measurements from three SLW catchments, DOC load into the reservoir was derived for a 17-year period. C stocks and stock changes between a baseline and two alternative management scenarios were compared to understand the relative impact of successive reservoir expansions and sustained harvest activity over the 100-year period. Results: Dissolved organic C flux for the three catchments ranged from 0.017 to 0.057 Mg Cha(-1) year(-1). Constraining CBM-CFS3 to observed DOC loads required parameterization of humified soil C3 losses of 2.5, 5.5, and 6.5%. Scaled to the watershed and assuming none of the exported terrestrial DOC was respired to CO2, we hypothesize that over 100 years up to 30,657 Mg C may have been available for sequestration in sediment. By 2012, deforestation due to reservoir creation/expansion resulted in the watershed forest lands sequestering 14 Mg Cha(-1) less than without reservoir expansion. Sustained harvest activity had a substantially greater impact, reducing forest C stores by 93 Mg Cha(-1) by 2012. However approximately half of the C exported as merchantable wood during logging (similar to 176,000 Mg C) may remain in harvested wood products, reducing the cumulative impact of forestry activity from 93 to 71 Mg Cha(-1) Conclusions: Dissolved organic C flux from temperate forest ecosystems is a small but persistent C flux which may have long term implications for C storage in inland aquatic systems. This is a first step integrating fluvial transport of C into a forest carbon model by parameterizing DOC flux from soil C pools. While deforestation related to successive reservoir expansions did impact the watershed-scale C budget, over multi-decadal time periods, sustained harvest activity was more influential.","2017-07-14","2020-10-01 03:36:38","2021-12-07 16:08:46","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\G8CJ8274\Smiley and Trofymow - 2017 - Historical effects of dissolved organic carbon exp.pdf","","Management; Pools; Journal Article; Soil; Aquatic; Transfer; DOC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of CQESTR, a process-based C model, in simulating SOC changes across toposequences of selected fields and agriculture management practices along a precipitation gradient in a dryland region of Oregon, USA. Geo-referenced soil samples were collected from summit (SU), shoulder (SH), backslope (BS), footslope (FS), and toeslope (TS) positions during early 1980s and early 2000s. Simulation scenarios were developed based on field management practices, crop rotations, soil properties, and climatic data. CQESTR simulated results were compared with the measured SOC from each landscape position. Significant (P<0.0001) correlations (r = 0.93) were found between the measured and the simulated SOC at SU, SH (r = 0.91), BS (r = 0.83), FS (r = 0.89), and TS (r = 0.89). The smallest correlation value at BS could be from soil deposition due to erosion. No significant changes in SOC were found between SU, SH, BS, and FS landscape positions; however, TS had the highest SOC (10.8 +/- .8 g C kg(-1)). CQESTR successfully simulated SOC at most of the studied sites and landscape positions, except at TS for a location with high annual deposition of C-rich soil eroded from the upper landscape position. CQESTR could be used to predict SOC changes across toposequence and at the landscape scale level with reasonable accuracy.

Fuel reduction treatments have been effective where fires coincide with treated areas. Fuel treatments also have the potential to reduce drought-mortality if tree density is uncharacteristically high, and to increase long-term carbon storage by reducing high-severity fire probability. Assess whether fuel treatments reduce fire intensity and spread and increase carbon storage under climate change. We used a simulation modeling approach that couples a landscape model of forest disturbance and succession with an ecosystem model of carbon dynamics (Century), to quantify the interacting effects of climate change, fuel treatments and wildfire for carbon storage potential in a mixed-conifer forest in the western USA. Our results suggest that fuel treatments have the potential to `bend the C curve', maintaining carbon resilience despite climate change and climate-related changes to the fire regime. Simulated fuel treatments resulted in reduced fire spread and severity. There was partial compensation of C lost during fuel treatments with increased growth of residual stock due to greater available soil water, as well as a shift in species composition to more drought- and fire-tolerant Pinus jeffreyi at the expense of shade-tolerant, fire-susceptible Abies concolor. Forest resilience to global change can be achieved through management that reduces drought stress and supports the establishment and dominance of tree species that are more fire- and drought-resistant, however, achieving a net C gain from fuel treatments may take decades.","2017-07","2020-10-01 03:36:39","2020-10-07 21:59:44","","1461-1472","","7","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\G49KLWNS\Loudermilk et al. - 2017 - Bending the carbon curve fire management for carb.pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; California; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although current estimates of major aquatic C fluxes represent an essential baseline against which future change can be compared, a comprehensive assessment for AK has not yet been completed. To address this gap, we combined available data sets and applied consistent methodologies to estimate river lateral C export to the coast, river and lake carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions, and C burial in lakes for the six major hydrologic regions in the state. Estimated total aquatic C flux for AK was 41 Tg C/yr. Major components of this total flux, in Tg C/yr, were 18 for river lateral export, 17 for river CO2 emissions, and 8 for lake CO2 emissions. Lake C burial offset these fluxes by 2 Tg C/yr. River and lake CH4 emissions were 0.03 and 0.10 Tg C/yr, respectively. The Southeast and South central regions had the highest temperature, precipitation, terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP), and C yields (fluxes normalized to land area) were 77 and 42 g C.m(-2).yr(-1), respectively. Lake CO2 emissions represented over half of the total aquatic flux from the Southwest (37 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)). The North Slope, Northwest, and Yukon regions had lesser yields (11, 15, and 17 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)), but these estimates may be the most vulnerable to future climate change, because of the heightened sensitivity of arctic and boreal ecosystems to intensified warming. Total aquatic C yield for AK was 27 g C.m(-2).yr(-1), which represented 16% of the estimated terrestrial NPP. Freshwater ecosystems represent a significant conduit for C loss, and a more comprehensive view of land-water-atmosphere interactions is necessary to predict future climate change impacts on the Alaskan ecosystem C balance.","2017-07","2020-10-01 03:36:39","2020-10-09 20:33:25","","1403-1420","","5","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\EKTKIKVG\Stackpoole et al. - 2017 - Inland waters and their role in the carbon cycle o.pdf","","Carbon Cycle; Journal Article; Alaska; Aquatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SCCs are used to estimate the benefits of CO2 reductions from policies. However, little is known about the modeling underlying the values or the implied societal risks, making SCC estimates difficult to interpret and assess. This study performs the first in-depth examination of SCC modeling using controlled diagnostic experiments that yield detailed intermediate results, allow for direct comparison of individual components of the models, and facilitate evaluation of the individual model SCCs. Specifically, we analyze DICE, FUND, and PAGE and the multimodel approach used by the US Government. Through our component assessments, we trace SCC differences back to intermediate variables and specific features. We find significant variation in component-level behavior between models driven by model-specific structural and implementation elements, some resulting in artificial differences in results. These elements combine to produce model-specific tendencies in climate and damage responses that contribute to differences observed in SCC outcomes - producing PAGE SCC distributions with longer and fatter right tails and higher averages, followed by DICE with more compact distributions and lower averages, and FUND with distributions that include net benefits and the lowest averages. Overall, our analyses reveal fundamental model behavior relevant to many disciplines of climate research, and identify issues with the models, as well as the overall multimodel approach, that need further consideration. With the growing prominence of SCCs in decision-making, ranging from the local-level to international, improved transparency and technical understanding is essential for informed decisions.","2017-05","2020-10-01 03:36:40","2020-10-08 19:54:23","","","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\T2VDDD69\Rose et al. - 2017 - UNDERSTANDING THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON A MODEL D.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Economics; Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Less is known about the effects of single, punctuated events in combination with other longer-duration anthropogenic influences on the dynamics of soil carbon (C) loss. In 2012 and 2013, we assessed the effects of decadal-scale anthropogenic global change -warming, increased nitrogen (N) deposition, elevated carbon dioxide (CO2), and increased precipitation - on soil respiration rates in an annual grass-dominated Mediterranean grassland. We also investigated how controlled fire and an artificial wet-up event, in combination with exposure to the longer-duration anthropogenic global change factors, influenced the dynamics of C cycling in this system. Decade-duration surface soil warming (1-2 degrees C) had no effect on soil respiration rates, while + N addition and elevated CO2 concentrations increased growing-season soil CO2 efflux rates by increasing annual aboveground net primary production (NPP) and belowground fine root production, respectively. Low-intensity experimental fire significantly elevated soil CO2 efflux rates in the next growing season. Based on mixed-effects modeling and structural equation modeling, low-intensity fire increased growing-season soil respiration rates through a combination of three mechanisms: large increases in soil temperature (3-5 degrees C), significant increases in fine root production, and elevated aboveground NPP. Our study shows that in ecosystems where soil respiration has acclimated to moderate warming, further increases in soil temperature can stimulate greater soil CO2 efflux. We also demonstrate that punctuated short-duration events such as fire can influence soil C dynamics with implications for both the parameterization of earth system models (ESMs) and the implementation of climate change mitigation policies that involve land-sector C accounting.","2017-05","2020-10-01 03:36:41","2021-12-06 17:12:05","","1975-1987","","5","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\C7HMFQ2F\Strong et al. - 2017 - Experimental fire increases soil carbon dioxide ef.pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; Flux; Soil; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To gain insight into changes in soil C and N pools, microbial biomass, and enzyme activities in response to soil coarseness, a field experiment was conducted by mixing native soil with river sand in different mass proportions: 0, 10, 30, 50, and 70% sand addition. Four years after establishing plots and 2 years after transplanting, soil organic C and total N concentrations decreased with increased soil coarseness down to 32.2 and 53.7% of concentrations in control plots, respectively. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN) declined with soil coarseness down to 44.1 and 51.9 %, respectively, while microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) increased by as much as 73.9 %. Soil coarseness significantly decreased the enzyme activities of beta-glucosidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase, and acid phosphomonoesterase by 20.2-57.5 %, 24.5-53.0 %, and 22.2-88.7 %, used for C, N and P cycling, respectively. However, observed values of soil organic C, dissolved organic C, total dissolved N, available P, MBC, MBN, and MBP were often significantly higher than would be predicted from dilution effects caused by the sand addition. Soil coarseness enhanced microbial C and N limitation relative to P, as indicated by the ratios of beta-glucosidase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase to acid phosphomonoesterase (and MBC: MBP and MBN: MBP ratios). Enhanced microbial recycling of P might alleviate plant P limitation in nutrient-poor grassland ecosystems that are affected by soil coarseness. Soil coarseness is a critical parameter affecting soil C and N storage and increases in soil coarseness can enhance microbial C and N limitation relative to P, potentially posing a threat to plant productivity in sandy grasslands suffering from desertification.","2017-04-27","2020-10-01 03:36:41","2021-12-07 16:57:19","","2155-2166","","8","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\XDL74899\Wang et al. - 2017 - Alteration of soil carbon and nitrogen pools and e.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Processes; Soil; DOC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mechanisms of DOM mobilization from Arctic soils, especially upper soil horizons which are drained most frequently through a year, are poorly understood. Here we conducted a short-term leaching experiment on surface and deep organic active layer soils, from the Yukon River basin, to examine the effects of DOM transport on bulk and molecular characteristics. Our data showed a net release of DOM from surface soils equal to an average of 5% of soil carbon. Conversely, deep soils percolated with surface leachates retained up to 27% of bulk DOM while releasing fluorescent components (up to 107%), indicating selective release of aromatic components (e.g., lignin and tannin), while retaining nonchromophoric components, as supported by spectrofluorometric and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectroscopic techniques. Our findings highlight the importance of the lateral flux of DOM on ecosystem carbon balance as well as processing of DOM transport through organic active layer soils en route to rivers and streams. This work also suggests the potential role of leachate export as an important mechanism of C losses from Arctic soils, in comparison with the more traditional pathway from soil to atmosphere in a warming Arctic.","2017-04","2020-10-01 03:36:42","2021-12-07 22:34:23","","796-810","","4","122","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\56VJXAQJ\Zhang et al. - 2017 - Importance of lateral flux and its percolation dep.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Alaska; Flux; Soil; Aquatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primary data for land preparation, plantation management, harvesting, and land restoration at each site and the production of cuttings at an additional facility were collected. A cradle to gate life cycle assessment was conducted using SimaPro PhD v8 based on the primary data and secondary data from the US life cycle inventory and ecoinvent v3 database to create a life cycle inventory. Impact indicators were provided by TRACI model. Short rotations resulted in lower global warming impact per unit output (79.5 and 54.5 kg CO2 eq/t) and energy consumption (1381.8 and 877.4 MJ/t) than long rotations (93.1 and 81 kg CO2 eq/t and 1406.9 and 1343.5 MJ/t) mainly due to reduced diesel use. Higher planting densities resulted in greater water and electrical consumption attributed to cuttings. Pesticide and herbicide use strongly affected ozone depletion and eutrophication, whereas fuel consumption had strong effects on global warming impact, smog, and acidification Increasing biomass yield reduced impacts. When the electricity was all from biomass, global warming and acidification decreased; however, ozone depletion, smog, and eutrophication increased.

We used a large number of forested plots (1646), detailed selection of species-specific and location-specific allometric equations, vegetation type maps with high levels of accuracy, and Monte Carlo simulation to model the amount and uncertainty of aboveground tree carbon present in tree species (hereafter, carbon) within Yosemite and Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks. We estimated aboveground carbon in trees within Yosemite National Park to be 25 Tg of carbon (C) (confidence interval (CI): 23-27 Tg C), and in Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Park to be 20 Tg C (CI: 18-21 Tg C). Low-severity and moderate-severity fire had little or no effect on the amount of carbon sequestered in trees at the landscape scale, and high-severity fire did not immediately consume much carbon. Although many of our data inputs were more accurate than those used in similar studies in other locations, the total uncertainty of carbon estimates was still greater than +/- 10%, mostly due to potential uncertainties in landscape-scale vegetation type mismatches and trees larger than the ranges of existing allometric equations.

In plants with longterm belowground storage, allocation of biomass to inaccessible parts belowground in response to folivory is a wellrecognized tolerance mechanism. In temperate regions, spring growth from buried rootstock is common among winter deciduous plants and is often followed by regrowth after defoliation, both of which draws resources from the stored reserves. We developed a mathematical model to analyze this tolerance response in a winter deciduous plant with long-term belowground biomass when it is defoliated by a specialist insect folivore. The model explores how three closely associated traits-(1) belowground biomass allocation to roots, (2) spring utilization of stored reserves, and (3) post-defoliation regrowth capacity-modulate the persistence and dynamics of the plant and herbivore populations. Model results show that allocation to belowground storage is not only a critical component of tolerance but also influences the herbivore population dynamics in ways that depend on how and when plant biomass is allocated and used. Low belowground biomass allocation and high storage utilization combined with poor photosynthetic growth caused extirpation of the plant population by the defoliating insects. Stable coexistence of the plant at low biomass along with its specialist insect required a moderate amount of post-herbivory belowground allocation. High values of belowground biomass allocation, storage utilization, and photosynthetic growth resulted in sustained cycles of the herbivore and plant populations. Interestingly, utilization of stored reserves had conflicting influence on above and belowground biomass, and strongly affected herbivore population dynamics. Our model thus highlights the complexity of tolerance response when it involves multiple traits and mechanisms as evinced by winter deciduous plants. We close by discussing the implications of our findings for the contributions of defoliating insects to biocontrol programs.","2017-03","2020-10-01 03:36:44","2020-10-09 23:52:47","","35-50","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\9Z6KMDIS\Thomas et al. - 2017 - Effects of aboveground herbivory on plants with lo.pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Roots; Journal Article; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large uncertainties remain about C dynamics following permafrost thaw in boreal peatlands. We used a chronosequence approach to measure C stocks in forested permafrost plateaus (forest) and thawed permafrost bogs, ranging in thaw age from young (< 10 years) to old (> 100 years) from two interior Alaska chronosequences. Permafrost originally aggraded simultaneously with peat accumulation (syngenetic permafrost) at both sites. We found that upon thaw, C loss of the forest peat C is equivalent to similar to 30% of the initial forest C stock and is directly proportional to the prethaw C stocks. Our model results indicate that permafrost thaw turned these peatlands into net C sources to the atmosphere for a decade following thaw, after which post-thaw bog peat accumulation returned sites to net C sinks. It can take multiple centuries to millennia for a site to recover its prethaw C stocks; the amount of time needed for them to regain their prethaw C stocks is governed by the amount of C that accumulated prior to thaw. Consequently, these findings show that older peatlands will take longer to recover prethaw C stocks, whereas younger peatlands will exceed prethaw stocks in a matter of centuries. We conclude that the loss of sporadic and discontinuous permafrost by 2100 could result in a loss of up to 24 Pg of deep C from permafrost peatlands.","2017-03","2020-10-01 03:36:44","2020-10-07 17:23:00","","1109-1127","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\YI3A362Q\Jones et al. - 2017 - Rapid carbon loss and slow recovery following perm.pdf","","Journal Article; Soil; Boreal; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering 7.2 M ha are dedicated to winegrape production globally, the potential for annual C capture and storage in this crop is of interest to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we used destructive sampling to measure C stocks in the woody biomass of 15-year-old Cabernet Sauvignon vines from a vineyard in California's northern San Joaquin Valley. We characterize C stocks in terms of allometric variation between biomass fractions of roots, aboveground wood, canes, leaves and fruits, and then test correlations between easy-to-measure variables such as trunk diameter, pruning weights and harvest weight to vine biomass fractions. Carbon stocks at the vineyard block scale were validated from biomass mounds generated during vineyard removal. Results: Total vine C was estimated at 12.3 Mg C ha(-)(1) of which 8.9 Mg C ha(-1) came from perennial vine biomass. Annual biomass was estimated at 1.7 Mg C ha(-1) from leaves and canes and 1.7 Mg C ha(-1) from fruit. Strong, positive correlations were found between the diameter of the trunk and overall woody C stocks (R-2 = 0.85), pruning weights and leaf and fruit C stocks (R-2 = 0.93), and between fruit weight and annual C stocks (R-2 = 0.96). Conclusions: Vineyard C partitioning obtained in this study provides detailed C storage estimations in order to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of winegrape C. Allometric equations based on simple and practical biomass and biometric measurements could enable winegrape growers to more easily estimate existing and future C stocks by scaling up from berries and vines to vineyard.","2017-02-16","2020-10-01 03:36:44","2020-10-07 23:12:14","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\BEFXMFZL\Morande et al. - 2017 - From berries to blocks carbon stock quantificatio.pdf","","Biomass; Pools; Journal Article; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SOM retains water and soil nutrients and stores more global carbon than do plants and the atmosphere combined. SOM is also decomposed by microbes, returning CO2, a greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere. Unfortunately, soil carbon stocks have been widely lost or degraded through land use changes and unsustainable forest and agricultural practices. To understand its structure and function and to maintain and restore SOM, we need a better appreciation of soil organic carbon (SOC) saturation capacity and the retention of above-and belowground inputs in SOM. Our analysis suggests root inputs are approximately five times more likely than an equivalent mass of aboveground litter to be stabilized as SOM. Microbes, particularly fungi and bacteria, and soil faunal food webs strongly influence SOM decomposition at shallower depths, whereas mineral associations drive stabilization at depths greater than similar to 30 cm. Global uncertainties in the amounts and locations of SOM include the extent of wetland, peatland, and permafrost systems and factors that constrain soil depths, such as shallow bedrock. In consideration of these uncertainties, we estimate global SOC stocks at depths of 2 and 3 m to be between 2,270 and 2,770 Pg, respectively, but could be as much as 700 Pg smaller.

Annual air-sea CO2 flux is greatest in the western North Pacific and decreases eastward across the basin (2.70.9molCm(-2)yr(-1) west of 170 degrees E, as compared to 2.10.3molCm(-2)yr(-1) east of 160 degrees W). East of 160 degrees W, DIC removal by annual net community production (NCP) more than fully offsets the DIC increase due to air-sea CO2 flux. However, in the region west of 170 degrees E influenced by deep winter mixing, annual NCP only offsets similar to 20% of the DIC increase due to air-sea CO2 flux, requiring significant DIC removal by geostrophic advection. Temperature-driven solubility changes have no net influence on pCO(2) and account for <25% of annual CO2 uptake. The seasonal timing of NCP strongly affects its influence on air-sea CO2 flux. Biological carbon export from the mixed layer has a stronger influence on pCO(2) in summer when mixed layers are shallow, but changes in pCO(2) have a stronger influence on air-sea CO2 flux in winter when high wind speeds drive more vigorous gas exchange. Thus, it is necessary to determine the seasonal timing as well as the annual magnitude of NCP to determine its influence on ocean carbon uptake.","2017-01","2020-10-01 03:36:46","2021-12-07 17:51:46","","81-95","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\VK2PDDJV\Palevsky and Quay - 2017 - Influence of biological carbon export on ocean car.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; Aquatic; Sea; Transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Challenges in differentiating between intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variation, both in theory and in practice, continue to confound claims of an anthropogenic carbon sink in forest biomass. Here we analyzed observations at 10,307 plots across southern ecozones of Canada to investigate temporal trends in stand-level biomass growth (G), biomass loss due to mortality (M), and net ecosystem biomass production (NEBP) of intact stands. Net extrinsic forcing (F-ex) was expressed by the collective dependence of biomass fluxes on climate anomalies, nitrogen deposition (N), and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (C). Inferences drawn directly from linear mixed-effects model coefficients only reflect the static behavior of the model specifically at field plot locations. We, therefore, defined a dynamic landscape-scale net extrinsic forcing (F-ex), which additionally accounted for potential negative feedback responses to anthropogenic growth enhancement. Simulations were performed over 1501-2012 to estimate F-ex. Overall, F-ex was positive, suggesting that environmental changes drove a 90% increase in NEBP. The increase in NEBP was confined to wet regions, while the biomass sink in dry regions decreased, suggesting that large expanses of northern forests, historically located near the boundary between wet and dry climates, may be at high risk of decline under continued increases in evaporative demand. These results have important implications for the greenhouse gas balance of Canada's forest sector.","2017-01","2020-10-01 03:36:46","2020-10-07 00:23:54","","134-158","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\N8FTP6G6\Hember et al. - 2017 - Increasing net ecosystem biomass production of Can.pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; Boreal; British Columbia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a probabilistic framework of wildfire occurrence to (1) estimate the potential for fuel treatments to reduce fire risk and hazard across the landscape and within protected California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) habitat and (2) evaluate the consequences of treatments with respect to terrestrial C stocks and burning emissions. Silvicultural and prescribed fire treatments were simulated on 20% of a northern Sierra Nevada landscape in three treatment scenarios that varied in the land area eligible for treatment. Treatment prescriptions varied with topography, vegetation characteristics, and ownership. We then simulated many wildfires in the treated and untreated landscapes. Additional simulations allowed us to consider the influence of wildfire size on estimated emissions. Treatments constrained to the land area outside of spotted owl activity centers reduced the probability of burning and potential fire intensity within owl habitat and across the landscape relative to no-treatment scenarios. Allowing treatment of the activity centers achieved even greater fire hazard reductions within the activity centers. Treatments also reduced estimated wildfire emissions of C by 45-61%. However, emissions from prescribed burning exceeded simulated reductions in wildfire emissions. Consequently, all treatment scenarios resulted in higher C emissions than the no-treatment scenarios. Further, for wildfires of moderate size (714-2133 ha), the treatment scenarios reduced the C contained in live tree biomass following simulated wildfire. When large wildfires (8070-10,757 ha) were simulated, however, the treatment scenario retained more live tree C than the no-treatment scenario. Our approach, which estimated terrestrial C immediately following wildfire, did not account for long-term C dynamics, such as emissions associated with post-wildfire decay, C sequestration by future forest growth, or longer-term C sequestration in structural wood products. While simulated landscape fuel treatments in the present study reduced the risk of uncharacteristically severe wildfire across the landscape and within protected habitat, the C costs of treatment generally exceeded the C benefits.","2017-01","2020-10-01 03:36:47","2020-10-05 18:50:21","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\3EB4VV53\Chiono et al. - 2017 - Landscape-scale fuel treatment and wildfire impact.pdf","","Fire; Management; Pools; Journal Article; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This changing fire regime, coupled with increased high-severity fire risk from a legacy of fire exclusion, could destabilize forest carbon (C), decrease net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and consequently reduce the ability of forests to regulate climate through C sequestration. While management options for minimizing the risk of high-severity fire exist, little is known about the longer-term carbon consequences of these actions in the context of continued extreme fire weather events. Our goal was to compare the impacts of extreme wildfire events on carbon stocks and fluxes in a watershed in the Sierra National Forest. We ran simulations to model wildfire under contemporary and extreme fire weather conditions, and test how three management scenarios (no-management, thin-only, thin and maintenance burning) influence fire severity, forest C stocks and fluxes, and wildfire C emissions. We found that the effects of treatment on wildfire under contemporary fire weather were minimal, and management conferred neither significant reduction in fire severity nor increases in C stocks. However, under extreme fire weather, the thin and maintenance burning scenario decreased mean fire severity by 25%, showed significantly greater C stability, and unlike the no-management and thin-only management options, the thin and maintenance burning scenario showed no decrease in NEE relative to the contemporary fire weather scenarios. Further, under extreme fire weather conditions, wildfire C emissions were lowest in the thin and maintenance burning scenario, (reduction of 13.7 Mg C/ha over the simulation period) even when taking into account the C costs associated with prescribed burning. Including prescribed burning in thinning operations may be critical to maintaining C stocks and reducing C emissions in the future where extreme fire weather events are more frequent.","2017-01","2020-10-01 03:36:47","2020-10-07 18:12:09","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\D4Q23ERA\Krofcheck et al. - 2017 - Restoring surface fire stabilizes forest carbon un.pdf","","Fire; Modeling; Pools; Journal Article; Flux; California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the present time, carbon market mechanisms to compensate those conserving blue carbon ecosystems, and thus reducing carbon emissions, are not yet in place. The ecosystem services provided by coastal vegetated ecosystems extend beyond their carbon storage capacity, and include their contribution to fishery production; shoreline protection; provision of habitat for wildlife and migratory species; flood water attenuation; nutrient cycling, pollution buffering; as well as their cultural, spiritual, subsistence and recreational uses. Because these services are of high economic, social and cultural value, the management and protection of blue carbon ecosystems could build collaboration between climate change and biodiversity practitioners on the national and international level. Such collaboration would also allow for the transfer of lessons learned from coastal management and conservation activities to carbon mitigation projects, and would include the need to work closely together with indigenous peoples and local communities. Resulting management activities on the local level could utilize and strengthen traditional knowledge and management systems related to blue carbon ecosystems, and increase both the resilience of biodiversity and that of coastal communities, as well as provide for long-term storage of blue carbon.

Sensitivity analysis explored the effects of cost of the depots on feasibility, including. policy designed to support depot establishment through subsidies. Scenarios were also used to assess the effects of increases in federal harvest activities.

The airborne lidar is used to link ground observations of AGB to space lidar measurements. Two sets of models are generated, the first relating ground estimates of AGB to airborne laser scanning (ALS) measurements and the second set relating ALS estimates of AGB (generated using the first model set) to GLAS measurements. GLAS then, is used as a sampling tool within a hybrid estimation framework to generate stratum-, state-, and national-level AGB estimates. A two-phase variance estimator is employed to quantify GLAS sampling variability and, additively, ALS-GLAS model variability in this current, three-phase (ground-ALS-space lidar) study. The model variance component characterizes the variability of the regression coefficients used to predict ALS-based estimates of biomass as a function of GLAS measurements. Three different types of predictive models are considered in CONUS to determine which produced biomass totals closest to ground-based national forest inventory estimates - (1) linear (LIN), (2) linear-no-intercept (LNI), and (3) log-linear. For CONUS at the national level, the GLAS LNI model estimate (23.95 +/- 0.45 Gt AGB), agreed most closely with the US national forest inventory ground estimate, 24.17 +/- 0.06 Gt, i.e., within 1%. The national biomass total based on linear ground-ALS and ALS-GLAS models (25.87 +/- 0.49 Gt) overestimated the national ground-based estimate by 7.5%. The comparable log -linear model result (63.29 +/- 1.36 Gt) overestimated ground results by 261%. All three national biomass GLAS estimates, LIN, LNI, and log -linear, are based on 241,718 pulses collected on 230 orbits. The US national forest inventory (ground) estimates are based on 119,414 ground plots. At the US state level, the average absolute value of the deviation of LNI GLAS estimates from the comparable ground estimate of total biomass was 18.8% (range: Oregon, -40.8% to North Dakota, 128.6%). Log-linear models produced gross overestimates in the continental US, i.e., >2.6x, and the use of this model to predict regional biomass using GLAS data in temperate, western hemisphere forests is not appropriate. The best model form, LNI, is used to produce biomass estimates in Mexico. The average biomass density in Mexican forests is 53.10 +/- 0.88 t/ha, and the total biomass for the country, given a total forest area of 688,096 km(2), is 3.65 +/- 0.06 Gt. In Mexico, our GLAS biomass total underestimated a 2005 FAO estimate (4.152 Gt) by 12% and overestimated a 2007/8 radar study's figure (3.06 Gt) by 19%.

To better understand the role of the slow responses in regulating interannual variability in NEE, we partitioned NEE into two major ecological terms gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco). We tested a set of hypotheses on seasonal scales using the flux and environment data collected from 2000 to 2015 in an oak-grass savanna area in California where ecosystems experience a wet winter and spring and a five-month-long summer drought each year. In our results, the spring season (Apr.-Jun.) contributed more than 50% of annual GPP and Reco. An analysis of outliers showed that each season could introduce significant anomalies in annual carbon budgets. The magnitude of the contribution depends on biotic and abiotic seasonal circumstances across the year and the particular sequences. We found that: (1) extremely wet springs reduced GPP in the years of 2006, 2011 and 2012; (2) soil moisture left from those extremely wet springs enhanced summer GPP; (3) groundwater recharged during the spring of 2011 was associated with the snowpack depth accumulated during the winter between 2010 and 2011; (4) dry autumns (Oct.-Dec.) and winters (Jan.-Mar.) decreased Reco significantly; (5) grass litter produced in previous seasons might increase Reco, and the effect of litter legacy on Reco was more observable in the second year of two consecutive wet springs. These findings confirm that biotic and abiotic extremes and legacies can introduce variations to annual ecosystem carbon balance, other than those that might be explained by the fast responses.

The recent occurrence of drought in California provides an important opportunity to examine drought response across ecosystem classes (forests, shrublands, grasslands, and wetlands), which is essential to understand how climate influences ecosystem structure and function. We quantified ecosystem resistance to drought by comparing changes in satellite-derived estimates of water-use efficiency (WUE = net primary productivity [NPP]/evapotranspiration [ET]) under normal (i.e., baseline) and drought conditions (Delta WUE = WUE2014 - baseline WUE). With this method, areas with increasing WUE under drought conditions are considered more resilient than systems with declining WUE. Baseline WUE varied across California (0.08 to 3.85 g C/mm H2O) and WUE generally increased under severe drought conditions in 2014. Strong correlations between Delta WUE, precipitation, and leaf area index (LAI) indicate that ecosystems with a lower average LAI (i.e., grasslands) also had greater C-uptake rates when water was limiting and higher rates of carbon-uptake efficiency (CUE = NPP/LAI) under drought conditions. We also found that systems with a baseline WUE <= 0.4 exhibited a decline in WUE under drought conditions, suggesting that a baseline WUE <= 0.4 might be indicative of low drought resistance. Drought severity, precipitation, and WUE were identified as important drivers of shifts in ecosystem classes over the study period. These findings have important implications for understanding climate change effects on primary productivity and C sequestration across ecosystems and how this may influence ecosystem resistance in the future.","2016-11","2020-10-01 03:36:49","2020-10-07 22:58:33","","","","11","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\U9G2K5MP\Malone et al. - 2016 - Drought resistance across California ecosystems e.pdf","","Journal Article; Processes; California; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study had the following objectives: (1) to examine spatial and temporal variations of canopy temperature; (2) to explore the effects of climate and soil conditions on canopy temperature; and (3) to quantify the relationships of canopy temperatures to forest-atmosphere heat and carbon fluxes. The temporal variation of 30-min mean canopy temperature was large, and leaf temperatures ranged from 2.1 to 33.6 degrees C during the study period. The temperature difference was small between the whole canopy and leaf regions, while tree stems had warmer temperatures than leaves, especially during the afternoon (12:00-19:59 h). The canopy thermal regime was largely controlled by climatic conditions and related to the soil thermal states. Air temperature, relative humidity, longwave radiation, and soil temperature at 2-cm depth were tightly correlated with 30-min and daily/sub-daily mean canopy leaf temperatures (r >= 0.6 or <= -0.6, p < 0.01). The daily/sub-daily mean canopy temperatures contained stronger relationships with the climatic and soil variables than the 30-min mean temperatures. During the afternoon, the mean leaf temperature was more closely related to net ecosystem exchange (r(2) = 0.69) than air temperature, driven by the strong relationship between tissue temperature and photosynthesis and respiration. Our results show that canopy thermal conditions can be monitored almost continuously for extended time periods to better characterize how canopies respond to environmental conditions. Finally, thermal measurements show great promise for quantifying linkages to carbon exchange in forest ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, carbon is of particular interest as policies for increasing carbon storage on federal lands are being proposed. However, a challenge in joint production analysis of forest management is adequately representing ecological conditions and processes that influence joint production relationships. We used simulation models of vegetation structure, forest sector carbon, and potential wildlife habitat to characterize landscape-level joint production possibilities for carbon storage, timber harvest, and habitat for seven wildlife species across a range of forest management regimes. We sought to (1) characterize the general relationships of production possibilities for combinations of carbon storage, timber, and habitat, and (2) identify management variables that most influence joint production relationships. Our 160 000-ha study landscape featured environmental conditions typical of forests in the Western Cascade Mountains of Oregon (USA). Our results indicate that managing forests for carbon storage involves trade-offs among timber harvest and habitat for focal wildlife species, depending on the disturbance interval and utilization intensity followed. Joint production possibilities for wildlife species varied in shape, ranging from competitive to complementary to compound, reflecting niche breadth and habitat component needs of species examined. Managing Pacific Northwest forests to store forest sector carbon can be roughly complementary with habitat for Northern Spotted Owl, Olive-sided Flycatcher, and red tree vole. However, managing forests to increase carbon storage potentially can be competitive with timber production and habitat for Pacific marten, Pileated Woodpecker, and Western Bluebird, depending on the disturbance interval and harvest intensity chosen. Our analysis suggests that joint production possibilities under forest management regimes currently typical on industrial forest lands (e.g., 40- to 80-yr rotations with some tree retention for wildlife) represent but a small fraction of joint production outcomes possible in the region. Although the theoretical boundaries of the production possibilities sets we developed are probably unachievable in the current management environment, they arguably define the long-term potential of managing forests to produce multiple ecosystem services within and across multiple forest ownerships.","2016-10","2020-10-01 03:36:50","2021-12-07 19:40:58","","2044-2059","","7","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\LURVIRP7\Kline et al. - 2016 - Evaluating carbon storage, timber harvest, and hab.pdf","","Management; Modeling; Journal Article; Oregon; Harvest; Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet the magnitude and direction of predator impacts on carbon cycling have not been widely quantified for terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we report on analyses of the potential for gray wolves to have cascading impacts on ecosystem carbon cycling. Our goal is to provide reasonable first approximations of their potential role in this fundamental ecosystem process. We find that gray wolves could lead to an increase in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of 24.0-52.0 g C . m(-2) . yr(-1) in Isle Royale's boreal forest, and a decrease in NEP of 30.03-102.88 g C . m(-2). yr(-1) in Yellowstone's grasslands. If such gray wolf impacts scale up to the broader North American boreal and grassland gray wolf range, these estimates suggest a potential for the indirect effects of wolves on yearly carbon fluxes to be on the same order of magnitude as the fossil fuel emissions of 6-20 million passenger cars per year.

Permafrost thaw also creates a fragmented landscape of drier and wetter soil conditions(3,4) that determine the amount and form (carbon dioxide (CO2), or methane (CH4)) of carbon (C) released to the atmosphere. The rate and form of C release control the magnitude of the permafrost C feedback, so their relative contribution with a warming climate remains unclear(5,6). We quantified the effect of increasing temperature and changes from aerobic to anaerobic soil conditions using 25 soil incubation studies from the permafrost zone. Here we show, using two separate meta-analyses, that a 10 degrees C increase in incubation temperature increased C release by a factor of 2.0 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.8 to 2.2). Under aerobic incubation conditions, soils released 3.4 (95% CI, 2.2 to 5.2) times more C than under anaerobic conditions. Even when accounting for the higher heat trapping capacity of CH4, soils released 2.3 (95% CI, 1.5 to 3.4) times more C under aerobic conditions. These results imply that permafrost ecosystems thawing under aerobic conditions and releasing CO2 will strengthen the permafrost C feedback more than waterlogged systems releasing CO2 and CH4 for a given amount of C.","2016-10","2020-10-01 03:36:51","2021-12-03 19:38:53","","950+","","10","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\NG2T6ANQ\Schadel et al. - 2016 - Potential carbon emissions dominated by carbon dio.pdf","","Journal Article; Flux; Soil; Perfmafrost; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many questions remain unaddressed regarding its long-term impacts, especially when accounting for the range of possible responses from the non-target vegetation (i.e., deciduous trees and lower-canopy shrubs and grasses). We used the Integrated BIosphere Simulator (IBIS) process-based ecosystem model along with the recently incorporated Marauding Insect Module (MIM) to quantify, over 240 years, the impacts of various MPB outbreak regimes on lodgepole pine merchantable biomass, ecosystem carbon, surface albedo, and the net radiative forcing on global climate caused by the changes in ecosystem carbon and albedo. We performed simulations for three locations in British Columbia, Canada, with different climatic conditions, and four scenarios of various coexisting vegetation types with variable growth release responses. The impacts of MPB outbreaks on merchantable biomass (decrease) and surface albedo (increase) were similar across the 12 combinations of locations and vegetation coexistence scenarios. The impacts on ecosystem carbon and radiative forcing, however, varied substantially in magnitude and sign, depending upon the presence and response of the non-target vegetation, particularly for the two locations not subjected to growing-season soil moisture stress; this variability represents the main finding from our study. Despite major uncertainty in the value of the resulting radiative forcing, a simple analysis also suggested that the MPB outbreak in British Columbia will have a smaller impact on global temperature over the coming decades and centuries than a single month of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production. Moreover, we found that (1) outbreak severity (i.e., per-event mortality) had a stronger effect than outbreak return interval on the variables studied, (2) MPB-induced changes in carbon dynamics had a stronger effect than concurrent changes in albedo on net radiative forcing, and (3) the physical presence of MPB-killed dead standing trees was potentially beneficial to tree regrowth. Given that the variability of pre-outbreak vegetation characteristics can lead to very different regeneration pathways, the four vegetation coexistence scenarios we simulated probably only sampled the range of possible responses.","2016-09-22","2020-10-01 03:36:51","2020-10-07 18:30:48","","5277-5295","","18","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\QB2GSNF2\Landry et al. - 2016 - Modelling long-term impacts of mountain pine beetl.pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Journal Article; Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, very little is known about the influence of fire on prairie bryophyte and lichen communities. In this study, we investigated the effects of fire on ground-dwelling bryophytes and lichens by estimating standing biomass, cover, mat depth and functional group diversity in burned and unburned plots at five prairie sites located in the south Puget Sound bioregion of Washington State. After accounting for differences among sites, the bryophyte and lichen ground layer in burned plots had about 18% the biomass and about 60% the cover of unburned plots. All ground layer functional groups had lower average biomass in burned plots, except for ephemeral mosses, which had greater biomass. Forage lichens and nitrogen-fixing lichens were absent from all five burned plots. Of particular concern are the regionally rare, state-listed reindeer forage lichens (Cladonia ciliata var. ciliata, Cladonia ciliata var. tenuis and Cladonia portentosa ssp. pacifica), which occur at three of the five prairies we surveyed. Our results indicate that some lichen populations could be extirpated from these sites if they are not considered in prescribed burn management plans. We suggest some options that could maintain ground layer integrity while balancing other management objectives in the south Puget Sound prairies.","2016-09","2020-10-01 03:36:51","2021-02-16 01:23:10","","470-483","","4","90","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\S7URH5TC\Calabria et al. - 2016 - Prescribed Fire Decreases Lichen and Bryophyte Bio.pdf","","Fire; Biomass; Journal Article; Washington","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measured soil C, N, Ca, P, and pH in forests of the Big Sur region of California impacted by the exotic pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, cause of sudden oak death, and the 2008 Basin wildfire complex. In Big Sur, overstory tree mortality following P. ramorum invasion has been extensive in redwood and mixed evergreen forests, where the pathogen kills true oaks and tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus). Sampling was conducted across a full-factorial combination of disease/no disease and burned/unburned conditions in both forest types. Forest floor organic matter and associated nutrients were greater in unburned redwood compared to unburned mixed evergreen forests. Post-fire element pools were similar between forest types, but lower in burned-invaded compared to burned-uninvaded plots. We found evidence disease-generated fuels led to increased loss of forest floor C, N, Ca, and P. The same effects were associated with lower % C and higher PO4-P in the mineral soil. Fire-disease interactions were linear functions of pre-fire host mortality which was similar between the forest types. Our analysis suggests that these effects increased forest floor C loss by as much as 24.4 and 21.3 % in redwood and mixed evergreen forests, respectively, with similar maximum losses for the other forest floor elements. Accumulation of sudden oak death generated fuels has potential to increase fire-related loss of soil nutrients at the region-scale of this disease and similar patterns are likely in other forests, where fire and disease overlap.","2016-09","2020-10-01 03:36:51","2020-10-05 19:02:33","","265-276","","1","182","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\SRFGTDCD\Cobb et al. - 2016 - Wildfire and forest disease interaction lead to gr.pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; Soil; California; Disturbance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mechanisms governing soil carbon accumulation and weathering during initial phases of ecosystem development are not well understood. We examined soil organic matter dynamics and soil development across a high-altitude (3,560-3,030 m) 20-kyr climate gradient on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Four elevation sites were selected (similar to 250-500 mm rainfall), which range from sparsely vegetated to sites that contain a mix of shrubs and grasses. At each site, two or three pits were dug and major diagnostic horizons down to bedrock (intact lava) were sampled. Soils were analyzed for particle size, organic C and N, soil pH, exchangeable cations, base saturation, NaF pH, phosphorous sorption, and major elements. Mass loss and pedogenic metal accumulation (hydroxlamine Fe, Al, and Si extractions) were used to measure extent of weathering, leaching, changes in soil mineralogy and carbon accumulation. Reactive-phase (SRO) minerals show a general trend of increasing abundance with increasing rainfall. However carbon accumulation patterns across the climate gradient are largely decoupled from these trends. The results suggest that after 20 kyr, pedogenic processes have altered the nature and composition of the volcanic ash such that it is capable of retaining soil C even where organic acid influences from plant material and leaching from rainfall are severely limited. Carbon storage comparisons with lower-elevation soils on Mauna Kea and other moist mesic (2,500 mm rainfall) sites on Hawaii suggest that these soils have reached only between 1% and 15% of their capacity to retain carbon. Our results suggest that, after 20 kyr in low rainfall and a cold climate, weathering was decoupled from soil carbon accumulation patterns and the associated influence of vegetation on soil development. Overall, we conclude that the rate of carbon supply to the subsoil (driven by coupling of rainfall above ground plant production) is a governing factor of forms and amount of soil organic matter accumulation, while soil mineralogy remained relatively uniform.","2016-09","2020-10-01 03:36:52","2021-12-03 19:17:03","","2384-2395","","9","97","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\TTP3ZMND\Kramer and Chadwick - 2016 - Controls on carbon storage and weathering in volca.pdf","","Pools; Journal Article; Soil; Climate; Hawai'i","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Modeled hydrology, soil thermal regime, carbon pools and fluxes, and methane emissions are evaluated using observation data at several peatland sites in Minnesota, Alaska, and Canada. The model is then applied for a 10,000 year (15 ka to 5 ka; 1 ka = 1000 cal years before present) simulation at four peatland sites. We find that model simulations match the observed carbon accumulation rates at fen sites during the Holocene (R-2 = 0.88, 0.87, 0.38, and -0.05 using comparisons in 500 year bins). The simulated (2.04 m) and observed peat depths (on average 1.98 m) were also compared well (R-2 = 0.91). The early Holocene carbon accumulation rates, especially during the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) (35.9 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), are estimated up to 6 times higher than the rest of the Holocene (6.5 g Cm-2 yr(-1)). Our analysis suggests that high summer temperature and the lengthened growing season resulted from the elevated insolation seasonality, along with wetter-than-before conditions might be major factors causing the rapid carbon accumulation in Alaska during the HTM. Our sensitivity tests indicate that, apart from climate, initial water table depth and vegetation canopy are major drivers to the estimated peat carbon accumulation. When the modeling framework is evaluated for various peatland types in the Arctic, it can quantify peatland carbon accumulation at regional scales.","2016-08","2020-10-01 03:36:52","2020-10-10 01:23:37","","2172-2185","","8","121","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\7KCMTKXR\Wang et al. - 2016 - Quantifying peat carbon accumulation in Alaska usi.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Processes; Alaska; Soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Examining C & nitrogen (N) accumulation rates over decades to centuries may provide additional understanding of the dominant mechanisms for their storage, which can be masked by seasonal and interannual variability when investigated over the short term. We examined longer-term accumulation rates, using Pb-210 and C-14 to date soil layers, for a wide variety of boreal ecosystems: a black spruce forest, a shrub ecosystem, a tussock grass ecosystem, a sedge-dominated ecosystem, and a rich fen. All ecosystems had similar decadal C accumulation rates, averaging 84 +/- 42 gCm(-2) yr(-1). Long-term (century) C accumulation rates were slower than decadal rates, averaging 14 +/- 5 gCm(-2) yr(-1) for all ecosystems except the rich fen, for which the long-term C accumulation rates was more similar to decadal rates (44 +/- 5 and 76 +/- 9 gCm(-2) yr(-1), respectively). The rich fen also had the highest long-term N accumulation rates (2.7 gNm(-2) yr(-1)). The lowest N accumulation rate, on both a decadal and long-term basis, was found in the black spruce forest (0.2 and 1.4 gNm(-2) yr(-1), respectively). Our results suggest that the controls on long-term C and N cycling at the rich fen is fundamentally different from the other ecosystems, likely due to differences in the predominant drivers of nutrient cycling (oxygen availability, for C) and reduced amounts of disturbance by fire (for C and N). This result implies that most shifts in ecosystem vegetation across the boreal region, driven by either climate or succession, will not significantly impact regional C or N dynamics over years to decades. However, ecosystem transitions to or from a rich fen will promote significant shifts in soil C and N storage.","2016-08-01","2020-10-01 03:36:53","2020-10-07 22:58:33","","4315-4327","","15","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\V5C25JSA\Manies et al. - 2016 - Decadal and long-term boreal soil carbon and nitro.pdf","","Journal Article; Sequestration; Alaska; Soil; Boreal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using integrated metagenomic technologies, we showed that the microbial functional community structure in the active layer of tundra soil was significantly altered after only 1.5 years of warming, a rapid response demonstrating the high sensitivity of this ecosystem to warming. The abundances of microbial functional genes involved in both aerobic and anaerobic carbon decomposition were also markedly increased by this short-term warming. Consistent with this, ecosystem respiration (R-eco) increased up to 38%. In addition, warming enhanced genes involved in nutrient cycling, which very likely contributed to an observed increase (30%) in gross primary productivity (GPP).

Variation of forest C density is especially pronounced in mountainous terrain, where environmental gradients are compressed and vary at multiple spatial scales. Additionally, the influence of environmental gradients may vary with forest age and developmental stage, an important consideration as forest landscapes often have a diversity of stand ages from past management and other disturbance agents. Quantifying forest C density and its underlying environmental determinants in mountain terrain has remained challenging because many available data sources lack the spatial grain and ecological resolution needed at both stand and landscape scales. The objective of this study was to determine if environmental factors influencing aboveground live carbon (ALC) density differed between young versus old forests. We integrated aerial light detection and ranging (lidar) data with 702 field plots to map forest ALC density at a grain of 25 m across the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, a 6369 ha watershed in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA. We used linear regressions, random forest ensemble learning (RF) and sequential autoregressive modeling (SAR) to reveal how mapped forest ALC density was related to climate, topography, soils, and past disturbance history (timber harvesting and wildfires). ALC increased with stand age in young managed forests, with much greater variation of ALC in relation to years since wildfire in old unmanaged forests. Timber harvesting was the most important driver of ALC across the entire watershed, despite occurring on only 23% of the landscape. More variation in forest ALC density was explained in models of young managed forests than in models of old unmanaged forests. Besides stand age, ALC density in young managed forests was driven by factors influencing site productivity, whereas variation in ALC density in old unmanaged forests was also affected by finer scale topographic conditions associated with sheltered sites. Past wildfires only had a small influence on current ALC density, which may be a result of long times since fire and/or prevalence of non-stand replacing fire. Our results indicate that forest ALC density depends on a suite of multi-scale environmental drivers mediated by complex mountain topography, and that these relationships are dependent on stand age. The high and context-dependent spatial variability of forest ALC density has implications for quantifying forest carbon stores, establishing upper bounds of potential carbon sequestration, and scaling field data to landscape and regional scales.

This study examined whether widely available plot-level merchantable tree volume could predict, for black spruce ecosystems in Canada's boreal forest, the relative proportions of sphagnum and feather moss ground cover and moss net primary productivity (NPP). A field study found that merchantable tree volume was significantly related to tree canopy openness (R-2 = 0.61, P < 0.001), which could then be used to model the relative ground cover of feather moss (R-2 = 0.5, P < 0.001) and sphagnum (R-2 = 0.45, P < 0.001) and NPP of feather moss (R-2 = 0.41, P < 0.001) and sphagnum (R-2 = 0.28, P < 0.001). The resulting MOSS-C submodel increased the accuracy of the CBM-CFS3's prediction of organic-horizon C five-fold and could explain large-scale variation in sites dominated by sphagnum with large organic-layer C pools but not fine-scale variation in dryer sites.

However, the potential to directly remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere by urban vegetation is still poorly supported by scientific evidence. Current assessments consider only the carbon accumulated by trees and usually neglect the contribution from soil respiration and the emissions associated with greenery management. Studies in mid-latitude cities suggest that the carbon uptake by urban vegetation is small compared to the magnitude of the anthropogenic emissions. To investigate if the typically evergreen vegetation in (sub)tropical cities has a larger potential for carbon sequestration, the CO2 flux data from two residential neighborhoods of Singapore and Mexico City were analyzed. Results suggest that (sub)tropical vegetation may act as either an emission source or sink depending on the species and characteristics of the trees and the amount and conditions of pervious surfaces for soil respiration. The biogenic component (vegetation and soil) was found to be a sink of 1 Mg km(-2) day(-1) of CO2 in Mexico City, but an emission source of 0.8 Mg day(-1) km(-2) of CO2 in Singapore.

Mid-elevation trees experience a montane Mediterranean climate, with near-freezing winter days and rain-free summers. The asynchrony between warmth and water input suggests low primary production, limited by photosynthetic dormancy in winter cold, and again in summer and early autumn with drought, yet this forest is characterized by tall trees and high biomass. We used eddy covariance in a mid-elevation Sierra stand to understand how winter cold and summer drought limit canopy photosynthesis and production. The trees exhibited canopy photosynthesis year-round. Trees avoided winter dormancy, and daytime CO2 uptake continued despite a deep snowpack and near-freezing temperatures. Photosynthesis on sunny days continued at half of maximum rates when air temperature was 0 degrees C. Likewise, the vegetation avoided summer drought dormancy, and high rates of daytime CO2 uptake and transpiration continued despite a 5-month period with only negligible water input. We attribute this drought avoidance to deep rooting and availability of deep soil water. Year-round photosynthesis helps explain the large biomass observed in the Sierra Nevada, and implies adaptive strategies that may contribute to the resiliency or vulnerability of Sierran vegetation to climate change.","2016-04","2020-10-01 03:36:56","2020-10-07 17:38:11","","459-468","","4","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\74BLQGB4\Kelly and Goulden - 2016 - A montane Mediterranean climate supports year-roun.pdf","","Biomass; Journal Article; California; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main goal of this study was to characterize C dynamics and net C exchange over two full crop years at two sites in the inland Pacific Northwest (iPNW). The iPNW is a highly productive dryland wheat growing region. The two measurement sites represent the low- and high-end of the regional precipitation gradient (250 and 550 mm year(-1), respectively). The low rainfall site is in a winter wheat-fallow rotation, while the high rainfall site is under continuous cropping with a rotation that includes winter wheat and pulse crops. The net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was monitored using the eddy covariance method. The winter wheat cropping years were strong CO2 sinks, with net uptake of 517 +/- 26 and 524 +/- 29 g Cm-2 year(-1) at the high- and low-rainfall sites, respectively. The fallow and pulse-crop years were close to neutral with respect to NEE, with a net uptake of 20 +/- 38 g Cm-2 year(-1) for garbanzo beans at the high rainfall site, and a net loss of 3 +/- 19 g Cm-2 year(-1) for the fallow season at the low rainfall site. Combining NEE with other carbon exchange terms, most importantly carbon import and export via seeding and harvest, gives the net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB). We found that even when harvest export was taken into account, both sites acted as net carbon sinks over the two year period: the NECB at the continuous cropping site was 202 +/- 60 g Cm-2, and the crop-fallow site had a NECB of 444 +/- 34 g Cm-2. These results present useful insights to field-scale C dynamics on finely resolved timescales. To understand the potential of soils as a long term C sink however, longer-term monitoring over multiple complete crop rotation cycles in combination with other field measurements or process-based models will be necessary.

We have established a pair of long-term eddy covariance flux towers at the R. J. Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF) near Pullman, Washington, US. The tower sites have similar crop rotation, weather conditions, and management practices except tillage. One site has been under no-till management (CAF-NT) since 1998, while the other site has used conventional tillage practice (CAF-CT) over the same time period. Measurements conducted above a garbanzo bean crop (Cicer arietinum) between October 2012 and September 2013 showed the CAF-NT site was close to CO2 neutral with an annual cumulative net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) of -20 +/- 38 g Cm-2. By contrast, the CAF-CT site was a CO2 source with an annual NEE of 117 +/- 39 g Cm-2 during the same time period. The annual NEE values at each site were significantly different (p <0.05). When carbon losses via harvest export were taken into account, the net rates of carbon loss from each ecosystem to the atmosphere were 32 +/- 50 and 178 +/- 48 g Cm-2 for CAF-NT and CAF-CT, respectively, indicating CAF-NT was close to carbon neutral and CAF-CT was a net carbon source during the measurement period. Partitioning of NEE into gross primary productivity (GPP) and total ecosystem respiration (R-eco) shows that the annual cumulative GPP of each site did not differ much, but CAF-NT had lower annual cumulative R-eco compared to CAF-CT during the period of October 2012-September 2013. Water budget analyses presented similar magnitudes of annual sums of evapotranspiration (ET), 425 and 416 mm for CAF-NT and CAF-CT, respectively. ET was partitioned into evaporation (E) and transpiration (7) for both sites, and CAF-CT had a larger fraction of annual E compared to CAF-NT during the measurement period. Relationships between carbon and water fluxes were investigated, and for the period of October 2012-September 2013, high correlations were found in GPP vs. T and NEE vs. ET at both sites. In summary, the site deploying no-till practices had lower total ecosystem respiration and evaporation throughout the measurement period, more net carbon uptake and a greater ratio of transpiration over evapotranspiration (T/ET) during the growing season.

We used a ground-based approach to compute decomposition of forest biomass killed, but not combusted, in the Biscuit Fire of 2002, an exceptionally large wildfire that burned over 200,000ha of mixed conifer forest in southwestern Oregon, USA. A combination of federal inventory data and supplementary ground measurements afforded the estimation of fire caused mortality and subsequent 10year decomposition for several functionally distinct carbon pools at 180 independent locations in the burn area. Decomposition was highest for fire killed leaves and fine roots and lowest for large-diameter wood. Decomposition rates varied somewhat among tree species and were only 35% lower for trees still standing than for trees fallen at the time of the fire. We estimate a total of 4.7TgC was killed but not combusted in the Biscuit Fire, 85% of which remains 10years after.

In this study, we used the eddy covariance technique to measure surface energy carbon fluxes from a constructed, impounded freshwater wetland during two annual periods that were 8years apart: 2002-2003 and 2010-2011. During 2010-2011, we measured methane (CH4) fluxes to quantify the annual atmospheric carbon mass balance and its concomitant influence on global warming potential (GWP). Peak growing season fluxes of latent heat and carbon dioxide (CO2) were greater in 2002-2003 compared to 2010-2011. In 2002, the daily net ecosystem exchange reached as low as -10.6gCm(-2)d(-1), which was greater than 3 times the magnitude observed in 2010 (-2.9gCm(-2)d(-1)). CH4 fluxes during 2010-2011 were positive throughout the year and followed a strong seasonal pattern, ranging from 38.1mgCm(-2)d(-1) in the winter to 375.9mgCm(-2)d(-1) during the summer. The results of this study suggest that the wetland had reduced gross ecosystem productivity in 2010-2011, likely due to the increase in dead plant biomass (standing litter) that inhibited the generation of new vegetation growth. In 2010-2011, there was a net positive GWP (675.3gCm(-2)yr(-1)), and when these values are evaluated as a sustained flux, the wetland will not reach radiative balance even after 500years.","2016-03","2020-10-01 03:36:58","2020-10-01 20:02:48","","777-795","","3","121","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ZY5D7H9Z\Anderson et al. - 2016 - Variation of energy and carbon fluxes from a resto.pdf","","Wetlands; Journal Article; Flux; Aquatic; Growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As temperature and interannual precipitation variability increase, the overall forest response is likely to be influenced by species-specific responses to changing climate. Management actions that alter composition and density may help buffer forests against the effects of changing climate, but may require tradeoffs in ecosystem services. We sought to quantify how projected changes in climate and different management regimes would alter the composition and productivity of Puget Lowland forests in Washington State, USA. We modeled forest responses to four treatments (control, burn-only, thin-only, thin-and-burn) under five different climate scenarios: baseline climate (historical) and projections from two climate models (CCSM4 and CNRM-CM5), driven by moderate (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) emission scenarios. We also simulated the effects of intensive management to restore Oregon white oak woodlands (Quercus garryana) for the western gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus) and quantified the effects of these treatments on the probability of oak occurrence and carbon sequestration. At the landscape scale we found little difference in carbon dynamics between baseline and moderate emission scenarios. However, by late-century under the high emission scenario, climate change reduced forest productivity and decreased species richness across a large proportion of the study area. Regardless of the climate scenario, we found that thinning and burning treatments increased the carbon sequestration rate because of decreased resource competition. However, increased productivity with management was not sufficient to prevent an overall decline in productivity under the high emission scenario. We also found that intensive oak restoration treatments were effective at increasing the probability of oak presence and that the limited extent of the treatments resulted in small declines in total ecosystem carbon across the landscape as compared to the thin-and-burn treatment. Our research suggests that carbon dynamics in this system under the moderate emission scenario may be fairly consistent with the carbon dynamics under historical climate, but that the high emission scenario may alter the successional trajectory of these forests.

We modelled foliage biomass and specific leaf area (SLA) using a sample of 60 lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and 60 white spruce (Picea glauca) that were destructively sampled in British Columbia, Canada. We modelled foliage biomass and SLA at three scales of organization: individual primary branches, annual shoots (all branches on an annual increment of the main stem), and the whole tree. We used a variety of independent variables that range in scale from the branch to plot level. Models of foliage biomass and SLA differ substantially between the two species even though their basic architectural design is quite similar. Models differed notably among levels of organization. For branch-level biomass, relevant variables for both species included branch diameter, length, age, distance to the crown base, and a measure of crown contact; however, at the annual-shoot level, relevant explanatory variables were mostly different between the species. At the whole tree level, only crown length was common to both species and all other explanatory variables differed. SLA was higher in spruce than pine for all age classes and canopy positions. Overall, the models allow prediction of important crown properties for two major conifers at a range of scales, and can thus contribute to better prediction of stand growth and other properties.

We used naturally occurring C isotopes (delta C-13 and Delta C-14) to partition R-eco into plant, young soil and old soil sources in a subarctic air and soil warming experiment over three years. We found that old soil contributions to R-eco increased with soil temperature and R-eco flux. However, the increase in the soil warming treatment was smaller than expected because experimentally warming the soils increased plant contributions to R-eco by 30%. On the basis of these data, an increase in mean annual temperature from -5 to 0 degrees C will increase old soil C losses from moist acidic tundra by 35-55 g C m(-2) during the growing season.

In doing so, we study the costs of monitoring, measuring, and contracting; the principal-agent problem; and questions related to life cycle analyses of CO2.

We discuss significant challenges in meeting these requirements, including some not previously recognized. Although we focus on sequestration in soil, many of the issues covered are applicable to all types of sequestration. The common-practice method for determining additionality achieves its intention of reducing transaction costs in the short term but not in the medium to long term. Its design results in the least costly, additional abatement-measures being excluded from policy support and fails to address how, in the case of sequestration, revisions to the additionality of sequestering practices should apply not just to the future, but in theory, also retrospectively. Permanence is sometimes approximated as 100 years of sequestration. Re-release of sequestered carbon after this will not only reverse the sequestration, but may raise atmospheric carbon to higher levels than they would have been if the sequestration had never occurred. Leakage associated with sequestration practices can accumulate over time to exceed the total level of sequestration; nonetheless, adoption of such practices can be attractive to landholders, even when they are required to pay for this leakage at contemporary prices.Policy relevanceGlobally, much has been written and claimed about the ability to offset emissions with sequestration. The Australian Government plans to use sequestration to source much of the abatement required to reach its emissions targets. Designing effective policy for sequestration will be challenging politically, and will involve substantial transaction costs. Compromises in policy design intended to make sequestration attractive and reduce transaction costs can render it highly inefficient as a policy.","2016","2020-10-01 03:37:00","2020-10-09 23:52:47","","973-992","","8","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\3HIY4EYY\Thamo and Pannell - 2016 - Challenges in developing effective policy for soil.pdf","","Journal Article; Sequestration; Soil; Offset; Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These processes contribute to C transfer to soils and to tree nutrition. Assessments of these characteristics and processes of root systems are important for understanding long-term supplies of nutrient elements essential for forest growth and resilience. Research and techniques have significantly advanced since Olof Tamm's 1934 “base mineral index” for Swedish forest soils, and the basic nutrient budget estimates for whole-tree harvesting systems of the 1970s. Recent research in areas that include some of the world's most productive and intensively managed forests, including Brazil and the USA, has shown that root systems are often several meters in depth, and often extend deeper than soil is sampled. Large amounts of carbon are also sometimes stored at depth. Other recent studies on potential release of nutrients due to chemical weathering indicate the importance of root access to deep soil layers. Nutrient release profiles clearly indicate depletion in the top layers and a much higher potential in B and C horizons. Reviewing potential sustainability of nutrient supplies for biomass harvesting and other intensive forest management systems will advance understanding of these important ecosystem properties, processes and services relevant for management.

Some of them have been applied globally but have yet to be shown to realistically represent soil carbon dynamics in the field. A thorough analysis of their key differences is needed to inform future model developments. Here we compare two nonlinear microbial models of soil carbon decomposition: one based on reverse Michaelis-Menten kinetics (model A) and the other on regular Michaelis-Menten kinetics (model B). Using analytic approximations and numerical solutions, we find that the oscillatory responses of carbon pools to a small perturbation in their initial pool sizes dampen faster in model A than in model B. Soil warming always decreases carbon storage in model A, but in model B it predominantly decreases carbon storage in cool regions and increases carbon storage in warm regions. For both models, the CO2 efflux from soil carbon decomposition reaches a maximum value some time after increased carbon input (as in priming experiments). This maximum CO2 efflux (F-max) decreases with an increase in soil temperature in both models. However, the sensitivity of F-max to the increased amount of carbon input increases with soil temperature in model A but decreases monotonically with an increase in soil temperature in model B. These differences in the responses to soil warming and carbon input between the two nonlinear models can be used to discern which model is more realistic when compared to results from field or laboratory experiments. These insights will contribute to an improved understanding of the significance of soil microbial processes in soil carbon responses to future climate change.","2016","2020-10-01 03:37:01","2020-10-10 01:23:37","","887-902","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\E573T683\Wang et al. - 2016 - Responses of two nonlinear microbial models to war.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Soil; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed an approach for rapid mapping of aboveground C density (ACD; units = Mg or metric tons C ha(-1)) on islands at a spatial resolution of 30 m (0.09 ha) using a combination of cost-effective airborne LiDAR data and full-coverage satellite data. We used the approach to map forest ACD across the main Hawaiian Islands, comparing C stocks within and among islands, in protected and unprotected areas, and among forests dominated by native and invasive species. Results: Total forest aboveground C stock of the Hawaiian Islands was 36 Tg, and ACD distributions were extremely heterogeneous both within and across islands. Remotely sensed ACD was validated against U.S. Forest Service FIA plot inventory data (R-2 = 0.67; RMSE = 30.4 Mg C ha(-1)). Geospatial analyses indicated the critical importance of forest type and canopy cover as predictors of mapped ACD patterns. Protection status was a strong determinant of forest C stock and density, but we found complex environmentally mediated responses of forest ACD to alien plant invasion. Conclusions: A combination of one-time airborne LiDAR data acquisition and satellite monitoring provides effective forest C mapping in the highly heterogeneous landscapes of the Hawaiian Islands. Our statistical approach yielded key insights into the drivers of ACD variation, and also makes possible future assessments of C storage change, derived on a repeat basis from free satellite data, without the need for additional LiDAR data. Changes in C stocks and densities of oceanic islands can thus be continually assessed in the face of rapid environmental changes such as biological invasions, drought, fire and land use. Such forest monitoring information can be used to promote sustainable forest use and conservation on islands in the future.","2016","2020-10-01 03:37:01","2020-10-01 21:48:07","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\4MLRADW3\Asner et al. - 2016 - Rapid forest carbon assessments of oceanic islands.pdf","","Biomass; Pools; Journal Article; Hawai'i","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even when two co-located maps are produced with low overall error, the spatial distribution of error may not be the same. Increasingly, methods will be needed to understand differences among purportedly similar products. For this study, we have used the four aboveground biomass (AGB) maps for conterminous US generated under NASA's Carbon Monitoring System. We have developed systematic approach to (1) assess both the absolute accuracy of individual maps and assess the spatial patterns of agreement among maps, and (2) investigate potential causes of the spatial structure of agreement among maps to gain insight into reliability of methodological choices in map making. Results: The comparison of the four biomass maps with FIA based total biomass estimates at national scale suggest that all the maps have higher biomass estimate compared to FIA. When the four maps were compared among each other, the result shows that the maps S and K have more similar spatial structure whereas the maps K and W have more similar absolute values. Although the maps K and W were generated using completely different methodological workflow, they agree remarkably. All the maps did well in the dominant forest type with maximum agreement between them. The comparison of difference between maps S and K with regional maps suggests that these maps were able to capture the disturbance and not so much regrowth pattern. Conclusions: The study provides a comprehensive systematic approach to compare and evaluate different real data products using examples of four AGB maps. Although ostensibly the four maps map the same variable, they have different spatial distribution at different scale. Except the 2003 map, one can use other maps at the coarser spatial resolution. Finally, the disparate information available through different maps indicates a need for a temporal framework for consistent monitoring of carbon stock at national scale.","2016","2020-10-01 03:37:02","2020-10-07 23:27:32","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\UCLU9WKI\Neeti and Kennedy - 2016 - Comparison of national level biomass maps for cont.pdf","","Modeling; Biomass; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet the net climate change mitigation of managed forests is affected by both tradeoffs between C sequestration and non-renewable C emissions and assessment methodology. As a case study, we measured ecosystem stocks to determine the potential C implications of converting pasture to managed eucalyptus forest and compared them with the eucalyptus production system's non-renewable C emissions. The forest border was chosen as the system boundary and operations spanned from forest establishment activities to harvested wood placed at the forest perimeter. Eucalyptus biomass C was 57.2 +/- 4.2 Mg C ha(-1) and soil C stock (to similar to 1 m depth) was approximately an order of magnitude greater. By the prevalent method for bulk density-based determination of C stock, conversion of pasture to eucalyptus forest significantly increased soil C stock by 17.5 +/- 8.0%. However, no significant change was detected by the equivalent soil mass method, a less prevalent but more accurate approach to detecting differences in soil C stock due to land use or management changes. A 7-year eucalyptus production cycle generated 1.0 Mg C ha(-1) in non-renewable emissions, which was far exceeded by the tree biomass C. Thus, even without significant soil C sequestration, this system provided a substantial climate change mitigation service by offsetting non-renewable energy use and C emissions associated with wood production, and providing opportunities for biofuel and bioenergy products to displace fossil fuel products.","2016","2020-10-01 03:37:02","2020-10-09 18:33:55","","171-181","","3-4","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\52KUJAXX\Crow et al. - 2016 - Carbon balance implications of land use change fro.pdf","","Management; Biomass; Pools; Journal Article; Land use; Hawai'i","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we investigated the effects of extreme drought and exotic plants, two of the most signiﬁcant threats to Mediterraneantype ecosystems, on soil microbial community composition and carbon metabolic genes within a four-year ﬁeld rainfall manipulation experiment. We combined measurements of bulk microbial and soil properties with high-throughput microbial community analyses to elucidate microbial responses and microbial-mediated alterations to carbon cycling. While microbial responses to experimental droughts were weak, scant rainfall periods resulted in decreased microbial biomass and activity, and relative abundances of bacterial groups such as Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Acidobacteria decreased concomitantly with increases in Actinobacteria, Chloroﬂexi, and Firmicutes abundance. Soils under exotic plants had increased temperatures, enhanced inﬁltration during rainfall events, and decreased water retention and labile carbon in comparison to soils under native plants. Higher peaks and more seasonally variable microbial activity were found under exotic plants and, like drought periods, the microbial community shifted towards osmotic stress life-strategies. Relationships found between microbial taxonomic groups and carbon metabolic genes support the interpretation that exotic plants change microbial carbon cycling by altering the soil microclimate and supplying easily decomposed high-quality litter.

High-productivity, low-vulnerability forests have the potential to sequester up to 5,450 Tg CO2 equivalent (1,485 Tg C) by 2099, which is up to 20% of the global mitigation potential previously identified for all temperate and boreal forests, or up to ~6 yr of current regional fossil fuel emissions.

From 1899 to 2002 aboveground carbon storage in live trees increased 2.5-fold from 97 Mg/ha to 263 Mg/ha. Despite burning in an uncharacteristically severe wildﬁre, the forest still contained 169 Mg/ha of live aboveground tree carbon in 2014. Direct ﬁre emissions were 72 Mg/ha and did not vary with canopy cover loss because emissions were largely driven by consumption of accumulated surface fuels. Areas that burned at low, moderate and high severity in the wildﬁre contained similar amounts of carbon in 1899, when the forest was still experiencing frequent low severity ﬁre. By 2002 the low severity areas contained 80 and 86 Mg/ha more aboveground live tree carbon than moderate and high severity areas respectively. The wildﬁre reinforced and ampliﬁed these diﬀerences in carbon storage that arose during ﬁre exclusion, such that carbon storage following the wildﬁre was more variable across the landscape. Additionally, the proportion of carbon stored in shade-intolerant, more ﬁre-sensitive species increased.

In the Sierra Nevada, fuels reduction approaches that include mechanical thinning followed by regular prescribed fire are one approach to restore the ability of the ecosystem to tolerate episodic fire and still sequester C. Yet, the spatial extent of the area requiring treatment makes widespread treatment implementation unlikely. We sought to determine if a priori knowledge of where uncharacteristic wildfire is most probable could be used to optimize the placement of fuels treatments in a Sierra Nevada watershed. We developed two treatment placement strategies: the naive strategy, based on treating all operationally available area and the optimized strategy, which only treated areas where crown-killing fires were most probable. We ran forecast simulations using projected climate data through 2,100 to determine how the treatments differed in terms of C sequestration, fire severity, and C emissions relative to a no-management scenario. We found that in both the short (20 years) and long (100 years) term, both management scenarios increased C stability, reduced burn severity, and consequently emitted less C as a result of wildfires than no-management. Across all metrics, both scenarios performed the same, but the optimized treatment required significantly less C removal (naive=0.42 Tg C, optimized=0.25 Tg C) to achieve the same treatment efficacy. Given the extent of western forests in need of fire restoration, efficiently allocating treatments is a critical task if we are going to restore adaptive capacity in frequent-fire forests.","2018-02","2020-11-05 18:16:45","2020-11-05 18:36:57","2020-11-05 18:16:45","729-737","","2","24","","Glob Change Biol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\EGEFVA9M\Krofcheck et al. - 2018 - Prioritizing forest fuels treatments based on the .pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; California; WD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we present results from a comparative analysis that examined mitigation options for British Columbia’s forest sector. Mitigation scenarios were evaluated using a systems perspective that takes into account the changes in emissions and removals in forest ecosystems, in harvested wood product (HWP) carbon stocks, and in other sectors where wood products substitute for emission-intensive materials and fossil fuels. All mitigation activities were assessed relative to a forward-looking ‘business as usual’ baseline for three implementation levels. In addition to quantifying net GHG emission reductions, we assessed economic, and socio-economic impacts as well as other environmental indicators relating to forest species, age class, deadwood availability and future timber supply. We further considered risks of reversal for land-based scenarios, by assessing impacts of increasing future wildfires on stands that were not harvested. Results:  Our spatially explicit analyses of forest sector mitigation options demonstrated a cost-effective portfolio of regionally differentiated scenarios that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Domestically, net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of -9 M­ tCO2e ­year -1 over 2020-2050 for a portfolio of mitigation activities at a default implementation level, with about 85% of the GHG emission reductions achieved below a cost of $50/tCO2e. Normalizing the net GHG reduction by changes in harvested wood levels permitted comparisons of the scenarios with different ambition levels, and showed that a 1 ­MtCO2 increase in cumulative harvested stemwood results in a 1 ­MtCO2e reduction in cumulative emissions, relative to the baseline, for the Higher Recovery scenario in 2070. Conclusions:  The analyses conducted in this study contribute to the global understanding of forest sector mitigation options by providing an integrated framework to synthesize the methods, assumptions, datasets and models needed to quantify mitigation activities using a systems approach. An understanding of economically feasible and socioeconomically attractive mitigation scenarios along with trade offs for environmental indicators relating to species composition and age, helps decision makers with long-term planning for land sector contributions to GHG emission reduction efforts, and provides valuable information for stakeholder consultations.","2020-12","2020-11-05 18:21:14","2021-03-01 23:08:16","2020-11-05 18:21:14","21","","1","15","","Carbon Balance Manage","Climate change mitigation in British Columbia’s forest sector","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\UL6N8FNG\Smyth et al. - 2020 - Climate change mitigation in British Columbia’s fo.pdf","","Journal Article; Economics; British Columbia; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"5GLNXLRJ","report","2017","","Baseline and projected future carbon storage and carbon fluxes in ecosystems of Hawai'i","","","","","https://doi.org/10.3133/pp1834","Hawaiʻi is unique among the United States because of its tropical climate, geographic isolation, high rates of species endemism, and discontinuous landmass. The year-round warm, wet climate on the windward sides of islands and the high fertility of relatively young volcanically derived soils are ideal conditions for carbon input, storage, and sequestration in ecosystems of the main Hawaiian Islands. Over the last three decades, several plot- and stand-level studies, conducted at the scale of tens to hundreds of square meters, have demonstrated the high carbon sequestration capacity of Hawaiian terrestrial ecosystems with a focus on soils, live biomass, and plant productivity. However, there have been relatively few studies conducted at landscape (hundreds to thousands of square meters) to islandwide scales examining the biotic and environmental controls on aboveground carbon density and no islandwide to statewide estimates of carbon fluxes and net carbon balance for ecosystems of the Hawaiian Islands. The goal of this report is to provide robust baseline estimates of carbon storage and flux across the Hawaiian Islands based on the best available data and to then use this baseline data as input to predict how carbon cycling and storage may respond to projected future changes in climate, land use, land cover, and disturbance. Major components of the assessment include a new high-resolution land-cover map for the State of Hawaiʻi; projected future shifts in climatic zones owing to global warming; baseline estimates of carbon emissions from wildfire; comprehensive statewide estimates of current ecosystem carbon stocks in soils, live biomass, and detritus; comprehensive statewide estimates of current carbon fluxes from gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re); current and projected future stream- and groundwater carbon fluxes to nearshore waters; and statewide estimates of current and projected future net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) based on projected changes in climate, wildfire, land use, and land cover. Major findings from the assessment are as follows: Total carbon stored in terrestrial ecosystems across the seven main Hawaiian Islands (excluding Niʻihau) was estimated to be 258 TgC, of which 71 percent was soil organic carbon (SOC) to 1 m depth, 24 percent was live biomass (above and below ground), and 5 percent was dead biomass (a combination of litter and downed woody debris). Hawaiʻi Island, the largest island in the Hawaiian archipelago, stored 136 TgC, which accounted for 58 percent of the total carbon storage in the State of Hawaiʻi, whereas the island of Kauaʻi had the highest carbon density (carbon storage per unit area), estimated as 23.5 kgC/m2. Live-biomass carbon storage in native forests was estimated as 32 TgC, which was 51 percent of all carbon stored as live biomass (63 TgC), followed by invaded forests (21 TgC) and alien tree plantations (6 TgC). Between 2003 and 2014, GPP across the seven islands averaged 20.2 TgC/yr, with Hawaiʻi Island accounting for 55 percent of this flux (11.2 TgC/yr). The island of Kauaʻi had the highest mean annual GPP carbon flux density (GPP per unit land area) estimated at 1.85 kgC/m2. Carbon lost to the atmosphere from wildfire emissions was estimated as 0.03 TgC/yr, and carbon lost to nearshore waters from stream- and groundwater fluxes was estimated as 0.3 TgC/yr for the current baseline period, which was approximately 4 percent of statewide annual net primary production (NPP) of terrestrial ecosystems. Terrestrial ecosystems of the seven main Hawaiian Islands sequestered an average of 0.34 TgC/yr during the baseline period, which was approximately 4 percent of statewide terrestrial NPP. Hawaiʻi Island represented the largest carbon sink, sequestering 0.24 TgC/yr or 70 percent of total statewide carbon sequestration. During the projected future period (2012–2061), carbon sequestration of terrestrial ecosystems of the State of Hawaiʻi would decrease by more than 30 percent (from 0.34 to 0.22 TgC/yr) primarily because of a decrease in NPP and increased carbon losses from land-use and land-cover change, as well as increased aquatic carbon-leaching losses to nearshore waters. The State of Hawaiʻi was projected to remain a net carbon sink in 2061, primarily because of carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems on Hawaiʻi Island. However, predicted land-use changes on the islands of Kauaʻi and Oʻahu were projected to convert these islands from net carbon sinks to net carbon sources to the atmosphere by 2061.","2017","2020-11-10 22:35:55","2021-12-07 19:12:20","","134","","","","","","","","","","","Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey","Reston, Virginia","en","","Professional Paper","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Series: Professional Paper","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\FUCL4H62\2017 - Baseline and projected future carbon storage and c.pdf","","Biomass; Pools; Flux; Soil; Aquatic; WD; Reports (non-GTR); Hawai'i","","","Selmants, Paul C.; Giardina, Christian P.; Jacobi, James D.; Zhu, Zhiliang","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1834","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we analyze 92,978 forest plots distributed across the conterminous United States to estimate biomass loss associated with elevated mortality rates caused by the 15 most damaging nonnative forest pests. We find that these species combined caused an additional (i.e., above background levels) tree mortality rate of 5.53 TgC per year. Compensation, in the form of increased growth and recruitment of nonhost species, was not detectable when measured across entire invaded ranges but does occur several decades following pest invasions. In addition, 41.1% of the total live forest biomass in the conterminous United States is at risk of future loss from these 15 pests.

Whereas severe abiotic disturbances (e.g., clear-cutting and fire) largely reset successional trajectories, pest and pathogen disturbances cause diffuse mortality, driving forests into nonanalogous system states. Biotic perturbations that disrupt forest carbon dynamics either reduce or enhance net primary production (NPP) and carbon storage, depending on pathogen type. Relative to defoliators, wood borers and invasive pests have the largest negative impact on NPP and the longest recovery time. Forest diversity is an important contributing factor to productivity: NPP is neutral, marginally enhanced, or reduced in high-diversity stands in which a small portion of the canopy is affected (temperate deciduous or mixed forests) but very negative in low-diversity stands in which a large portion of the canopy is affected (western US forests). Pests and pathogens reduce forest structural and functional redundancy, affecting their resilience to future climate change or new outbreaks. Therefore, pests and pathogens can be considered biotic forcing agents capable of causing consequences of similar magnitude to climate forcing factors.","2015","2022-01-26 22:53:13","2022-01-26 22:54:56","","547-569","","","66","","Annual review of plant biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Annual Reviews","","","","Journal Article; Disease; Insects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model leverages decades of research and development on the respective forest growth and wildfire simulation models, and their integration creates a strategic forest landscape model that has a high degree of transparency in the existing user communities. The study area has been targeted for forest restoration investments in response to wildland fires that are increasingly impacting ecological conditions, conservation areas, amenity values, and surrounding communities. We simulated three alternative spatial investment priorities and three levels of management intensity (area treated) over a 50-year timespan and measured the response in terms of area burned, fire severity, wildlandurban interface exposure and timber production. We found that the backlog of areas in need of restoration on the national forest could be eliminated in 20 years when the treatment rate was elevated to a maximum of 3× the current level. However, higher rates of treatments early in the simulation created a future need to address the rapid buildup of fuels associated with understory shrub and tree regeneration. Restoration treatments over time had a large effect on fire severity, on average reducing potential flame length by up to 26% for the study area within the first 20 years, whereas reductions in area burned were relatively small. Although wildfire contributed to reducing flame length over time, area burned was only 16% of the total disturbed area (managed and burned with prescribed fire) under the 3× management intensity. Interactions among spatial treatment scenarios and treatment intensities were minimal, although inter-annual variability was extreme, with the coefficient of variation in burned area exceeding 200%. We also observed simulated fires that exceeded four times the historically recorded fire size. Fire regime variability has manifold significance since very large fires can homogenize fuels and eliminate clumpy stand structure that historically reduced fire size and maintained landscape resiliency. We discuss specific research needs to better understand future wildfire activity and the relative influence of climate, fuels, fire feedbacks, and management to achieve fire resiliency goals on western US fire frequent forests.","2020-04","2021-12-08 18:09:04","2021-12-08 18:10:12","2021-12-08 18:09:04","108962","","","421","","Ecological Modelling","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\V27I38U6\Ager et al. - 2020 - Modelling the effect of accelerated forest managem.pdf","","Fire; Management; Modeling; Journal Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper synthesizes understanding of the potential effects of changing climate and fire regimes on Pacific Northwest forests, including effects on disturbance and stress interactions, forest structure and composition, and post-fire ecological processes. We frame this information in a risk assessment context, and conclude with management implications and future research needs. Results: Large and severe fires in the Pacific Northwest are associated with warm and dry conditions, and such conditions will likely occur with increasing frequency in a warming climate. According to projections based on historical records, current trends, and simulation modeling, protracted warmer and drier conditions will drive lower fuel moisture and longer fire seasons in the future, likely increasing the frequency and extent of fires compared to the twentieth century. Interactions between fire and other disturbances, such as drought and insect outbreaks, are likely to be the primary drivers of ecosystem change in a warming climate. Reburns are also likely to occur more frequently with warming and drought, with potential effects on tree regeneration and species composition. Hotter, drier sites may be particularly at risk for regeneration failures. Conclusion: Resource managers will likely be unable to affect the total area burned by fire, as this trend is driven strongly by climate. However, fuel treatments, when implemented in a spatially strategic manner, can help to decrease fire intensity and severity and improve forest resilience to fire, insects, and drought. Where fuel treatments are less effective (wetter, high-elevation, and coastal forests), managers may consider implementing fuel breaks around high-value resources. When and where post-fire planting is an option, planting different genetic stock than has been used in the past may increase seedling survival. Planting seedlings on cooler, wetter microsites may also help to increase survival. In the driest topographic locations, managers may need to consider where they will try to forestall change and where they will allow conversions to vegetation other than what is currently dominant.","2020-12","2020-12-01 23:43:42","2020-12-01 23:44:01","2020-12-01 23:43:42","4","","1","16","","fire ecol","Changing wildfire, changing forests","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\TCQB4RKH\Halofsky et al. - 2020 - Changing wildfire, changing forests the effects o.pdf","","Fire; Journal Article; Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous baseline assessments of carbon stocks (https://www.fs.fed.us/managing-land/sc/carbon) evaluated observed trends based on forest inventory data but were limited in ability to reveal detailed causes of these trends. The expanded assessments reported here are based on an extensive disturbance and climate history for each national forest, and two forest carbon models, to estimate the relative impacts of disturbance (e.g., fires, harvests, insect outbreaks, disease) and nondisturbance factors (climate, carbon dioxide concentration, nitrogen deposition). Results are summarized for each region of the National Forest System in the main document. A set of regional appendices to this report provides more detailed information about individual national forests within each region. Results are highly variable across the United States. Generally, carbon stocks are increasing in forests of the eastern United States as these forests continue to recover and grow older after higher historical harvesting rates and periods of nonforest land use. In contrast, carbon stocks in forests of the western United States may be either increasing or decreasing, depending on recent effects of natural disturbances and climate change. The information supports national forest units in assessing carbon stocks, quantifying carbon outcomes of broad forest management strategies and planning, and meeting carbon assessment requirements of the 2012 Planning Rule and directives. Results of these expanded assessments will provide context for project-level decisions, separated from the effects of factors that are beyond land managers’ control.","2019","2021-11-19 16:24:32","2021-11-30 18:01:47","2021-11-19 16:24:32","116","","","","","","","","","","","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station","Ft.

Main sections are introduced with a brief paragraph in italics which outlines the methodological basis of the assessment. The degree of certainty in key findings in this assessment is based on the author teams’ evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confidence (from very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain). Confidence in the validity of a finding is based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement1 . Probabilistic estimates of quantified measures of uncertainty in a finding are based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgment. Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers.

The ecosystem services and biodiversity that forests provide will be influenced by the behaviors ofnumerous individual private landowners as they alter their use of forests in response to climate change and any future carbon pricing policies that emerge. We evaluated the impact of forest landowners’ likely adaptation behaviors on potential habitat for 35 terrestrial, forest-dependent vertebrates across three U.S. Pacific states. In particular, we couple a previously estimated empirical-economic model of forest management with spatially explicit species’ range and habitat associations to quantify the effects of adaptation to climate change and carbon pricing on potential habitat for our focal species (amphibians, birds and mammals) drawn from state agency lists ofspecies of conservation concern. We show that both climate change and carbon pricing policies would likely encourage adaptation away from currently prevalent coniferous forest types, such as Douglas-fir, largely through harvest and planting decisions. This would reduce potential habitat for a majority of the focal species we studied across all three vertebrate taxa. The total anticipated habitat loss for amphibians, birds and mammals considered species of state concern would exceed total habitat gained, and the net loss in habitat per decade would accelerate over time. Carbon payments to forest landowners likely would lead to unintended localized habitat losses especially in Douglas-fir dominant forest types, and encourage more hardwoods on private forest lands. Our study highlights potential tradeoffs that could arise from pricing one ecosystem service (e.g., carbon) while leaving others (e.g., wildlife habitat) unpriced. Our study demonstrates the importance of anticipating potential changes in ecosystem services and biodiversity resulting from forest landowners’ climate adaptation behavior and accounting for a broader set ofenvironmental benefits and costs when designing policies to address climate change.","2020-04-02","2022-11-02 18:41:44","2022-11-02 18:46:57","2022-11-02 18:41:44","e0230525","","4","15","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\JBZRBT9V\Hashida et al. - 2020 - Anticipating changes in wildlife habitat induced b.pdf","","Modeling; Journal Article; Economics; Climate; Land use","","Peacock, Mary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the SOC models used on a regional to national scale share the principle of process-based multi-compartment models, but differ in their initialization or decomposition modifying factors. We performed a model comparison to identify the model or multi-model ensemble that best fits trends in SOC stocks of German croplands. We combined six SOC models (C-TOOL, CCB, CENTURY, ROTH-C, ICBM and YASSO07) with five C input estimation methods (bolinder, bze, ccb, ctool, ipcc-nir), producing a model set of 30 model combinations. We used data from agricultural permanent soil monitoring sites in Germany to compare modeled and measured trends of SOC stock time series. The absolute mean error (AME) of the trends for the model combinations varied between 0.01 Mg ha−1 a−1 and 0.86 Mg ha−1 a−1, with C-TOOL, CENTURY and YASSO07 generally showing smaller AME than ICBM and CCB. The scatter of the modeled trends of the 30 model combinations indicated that the choice of SOC model was more important than the choice of C input estimation method. A multi-objective criterion was used to summarize results from AME, root mean squared error (RMSE) and the probability that the measured trend lies within the confidence interval of the modeled trend. We set up a multi-model ensemble consisting of all 30 model combinations, and reduced the number of participating models until the multi-objective criterion of the ensemble was smallest. A multimodel ensemble with nine model combinations was found to be the best ensemble. The multi-model ensemble performed better than the single model combinations, with AME of 0.004 Mg ha−1 a−1 and RMSE of 0.56 Mg ha−1 a−1. Based on our results, we recommend the use of a multi-model ensemble for predicting trends in SOC stocks as it reduces structural uncertainties and solves the problem of choosing the right SOC model or C input estimation method.","2019-07","2022-11-28 21:40:37","2022-11-28 21:40:37","2022-11-28 21:40:37","17-30","","","345","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\83SV8Y73\Riggers et al. - 2019 - Multi-model ensemble improved the prediction of tr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regression kriging is a widely used hybrid approach of spatial variation that combines correlation between soil properties and environmental factors with spatial autocorrelation between soil observations. In this study, we compared four machine learning approaches (gradient boosting machine, multinarrative adaptive regression spline, random forest, and support vector machine) with regression kriging to predict the spatial variation of surface (0–30 cm) soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at 250-m spatial resolution across the northern circumpolar permafrost region. We combined 2,374 soil proﬁle observations (calibration datasets) with georeferenced datasets of environmental factors (climate, topography, land cover, bedrock geology, and soil types) to predict the spatial variation of surface SOC stocks. We evaluated the prediction accuracy at randomly selected sites (validation datasets) across the study area. We found that different techniques inferred different numbers of environmental factors and their relative importance for prediction of SOC stocks. Regression kriging produced lower prediction errors in comparison to multinarrative adaptive regression spline and support vector machine, and comparable prediction accuracy to gradient boosting machine and random forest. However, the ensemble median prediction of SOC stocks obtained from all four machine learning techniques showed highest prediction accuracy. Although the use of different approaches in spatial prediction of soil properties will depend on the availability of soil and environmental datasets and computational resources, we conclude that the ensemble median prediction obtained from multiple machine learning approaches provides greater spatial details and produces the highest prediction accuracy. Thus an ensemble prediction approach can be a better choice than any single prediction technique for predicting the spatial variation of SOC stocks.","2020-10-28","2022-11-28 21:44:27","2022-11-28 21:44:28","2022-11-28 21:44:27","528441","","","3","","Front.

We review current estimates of SOC stocks and mass (stock × area) in wetlands, permafrost and tropical regions and the world in the upper 1 m of soil. The Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) v.1.2 provides one of the most recent and coherent global data sets of SOC, giving a total mass of 2476 Pg when using the original values for bulk density. Adjusting the HWSD’s bulk density (BD) of soil high in organic carbon results in a mass of 1230 Pg, and additionally setting the BD of Histosols to 0.1 g cm−3 (typical of peat soils), results in a mass of 1062 Pg. The uncertainty in BD of Histosols alone introduces a range of −56 to +180 Pg C into the estimate of global SOC mass in the top 1 m, larger than estimates of global soil respiration. We report the spatial distribution of SOC stocks per 0.5 arcminutes; the areal masses of SOC; and the quantiles of SOC stocks by continents, wetland types, and permafrost types. Depending on the deﬁnition of “wetland”, wetland soils contain between 82 and 158 Pg SOC. With more detailed estimates for permafrost from the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (496 Pg SOC) and tropical peatland carbon incorporated, global soils contain 1325 Pg SOC in the upper 1 m, including 421 Pg in tropical soils, whereof 40 Pg occurs in tropical wetlands. Global SOC amounts to just under 3000 Pg when estimates for deeper soil layers are included. Variability in estimates is due to variation in deﬁnitions of soil units, differences in soil property databases, scarcity of information about soil carbon at depths > 1 m in peatlands, and variation in deﬁnitions of “peatland”.","2015-04-16","2023-01-18 18:52:36","2023-01-18 18:52:39","2023-01-18 18:52:36","351-365","","1","1","","SOIL","Global distribution of soil organic carbon – Part 1","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\CT8U8ZUP\Köchy et al. - 2015 - Global distribution of soil organic carbon – Part .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Estimating the size and spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss due to land use and land cover change has been difficult but is a critical step in understanding whether SOC sequestration can be an effective climate mitigation strategy. In this study, a machine learning-based model was fitted using a global compilation of SOC data and the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) land use data in combination with climatic, landform and lithology covariates. Model results compared favorably with a global compilation of paired plot studies. Projection of this model onto a world without agriculture indicated a global carbon debt due to agriculture of 133 Pg C for the top 2 m of soil, with the rate of loss increasing dramatically in the past 200 years. The HYDE classes “grazing” and “cropland” contributed nearly equally to the loss of SOC. There were higher percent SOC losses on cropland but since more than twice as much land is grazed, slightly higher total losses were found from grazing land. Important spatial patterns of SOC loss were found: Hotspots of SOC loss coincided with some major cropping regions as well as semiarid grazing regions, while other major agricultural zones showed small losses and even net gains in SOC. This analysis has demonstrated that there are identifiable regions which can be targeted for SOC restoration efforts.","2017-09-05","2023-01-18 18:55:23","2023-01-18 18:57:58","2023-01-18 18:55:23","9575-9580","","36","114","","Proc.

As such, there is a growing requirement for global soil information. Although several global soil information systems already exist, these tend to suffer from inconsistencies and limited spatial detail. Methodology/Principal Findings: We present SoilGrids1km — a global 3D soil information system at 1 km resolution —containing spatial predictions for a selection of soil properties (at six standard depths): soil organic carbon (g kg21), soil pH, sand, silt and clay fractions (%), bulk density (kg m23), cation-exchange capacity (cmol+/kg), coarse fragments (%), soil organic carbon stock (t ha21), depth to bedrock (cm), World Reference Base soil groups, and USDA Soil Taxonomy suborders. Our predictions are based on global spatial prediction models which we fitted, per soil variable, using a compilation of major international soil profile databases (ca. 110,000 soil profiles), and a selection of ca. 75 global environmental covariates representing soil forming factors. Results of regression modeling indicate that the most useful covariates for modeling soils at the global scale are climatic and biomass indices (based on MODIS images), lithology, and taxonomic mapping units derived from conventional soil survey (Harmonized World Soil Database). Prediction accuracies assessed using 5–fold cross-validation were between 23–51%. Conclusions/Significance: SoilGrids1km provide an initial set of examples of soil spatial data for input into global models at a resolution and consistency not previously available. Some of the main limitations of the current version of SoilGrids1km are: (1) weak relationships between soil properties/classes and explanatory variables due to scale mismatches, (2) difficulty to obtain covariates that capture soil forming factors, (3) low sampling density and spatial clustering of soil profile locations. However, as the SoilGrids system is highly automated and flexible, increasingly accurate predictions can be generated as new input data become available.

The project, which started in 1961, fills a gap in present knowledge of soil potentialities throughout the world and provides a useful instrument in planning agricultural and economic development programmes. The project has been carried out under the scientific authority of an international advisory panel, within the frameworkof FAO and Unesco programmes. The different stages of the work included comparative studies of soilmaps, field and laboratory work, and the organization of international expert meetings and study tours. The secretariat of the joint project, located at FAO Headquarters, was vested with the responsibility ofcompiling the technical information, correlating the studies and coordinating the drafting of the maps and text. FAOand Unesco shared the expenses involved in the realization of the project, and Unesco undertook publication of its results. The present volume, covering the soils of North America, is the second of a set of ten which make up the complete publication of the Soi lMap of the World. The first volume records introductory information and presents the definitions of the elements of the legend which is used uniformly throughout the publication.

Longterm experiments since 1843 at Rothamsted provide the longest data sets on the effect of soil, crop, manuring, and management on changes in soil organic matter under temperate climatic conditions. The amount of organic matter in soil depends on the input of organic material, its rate of decomposition, the rate at which existing soil organic matter is mineralized, soil texture, and climate. All four factors interact so that the amount of soil organic matter changes, often slowly, toward an equilibrium value specific to the soil type and farming system. For any one cropping system, the equilibrium level of soil organic matter in a clay soil will be larger than that in a sandy soil, and for any one soil type the value will be larger with permanent grass than with continuous arable cropping. Trends in long-term crop yields show that as yield potential has increased, yields are often larger on soils with more organic matter compared to those on soils with less. The effects of nitrogen, improvements in soil phosphorus availability, and other factors are discussed. Benefits from building up soil organic matter are bought at a cost with large losses of both carbon and nitrogen from added organic material. Models for the buildup and decline of soil organic matter, the source and sink of carbon dioxide in soil, are presented.","2009","2023-03-13 20:42:42","2023-03-13 20:42:48","2023-03-13 20:42:42","1-57","","","101","","","","","","","","Elsevier","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1016/S0065-2113(08)00801-8","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\SCX5SRBL\Johnston et al. - 2009 - Chapter 1 Soil Organic Matter.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent eﬀorts to assess the impact of land management on soil functionality proposed that an indicator- or proxy-based approach is a promising alternative to quantify soil functions compared to time- and cost-intensive measurements, particularly when larger regions are targeted. The objective of this review is to identify measurable biotic or abiotic properties that control soil organic carbon (SOC) storage at diﬀerent spatial scales and could serve as indicators for an eﬃcient quantiﬁcation of SOC. These indicators should enable both an estimation of actual SOC storage as well as a prediction of the SOC storage potential, which is an important aspect in land use and management planning. There are many environmental conditions that aﬀect SOC storage at diﬀerent spatial scales. We provide a thorough overview of factors from micro-scales (particles to pedons) to the global scale and discuss their suitability as indicators for SOC storage: clay mineralogy, speciﬁc surface area, metal oxides, Ca and Mg cations, microorganisms, soil fauna, aggregation, texture, soil type, natural vegetation, land use and management, topography, parent material and climate. As a result, we propose a set of indicators that allow for time- and cost-eﬃcient estimates of actual and potential SOC storage from the local to the regional and subcontinental scale. As a key element, the ﬁne mineral fraction was identiﬁed to determine SOC stabilization in most soils. The quantiﬁcation of SOC can be further reﬁned by including climatic proxies, particularly elevation, as well as information on land use, soil management and vegetation characteristics. To enhance its indicative power towards land management eﬀects, further “functional soil characteristics”, particularly soil structural properties and changes in the soil microbial biomass pool should be included in this indicator system. The proposed system oﬀers the potential to eﬃciently estimate the SOC storage capacity by means of simpliﬁed measures, such as soil fractionation procedures or infrared spectroscopic approaches.","2019-01","2023-03-13 20:49:13","2023-03-13 20:49:17","2023-03-13 20:49:13","149-162","","","333","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\XG2W3TFZ\Wiesmeier et al. - 2019 - Soil organic carbon storage as a key function of s.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, adoption of SOC-sequestration measures will take time, and reasonably such schemes could only be implemented gradually at large-scale. Secondly, if soils are managed as carbon sinks, then SOC will increase only over a limited time, up to the point when a new SOC equilibrium is reached. This paper combines these two processes and predicts potential SOC sequestration dynamics in agricultural land at global scale and the corresponding CC mitigation potential. Assuming that global governments would agree on a worldwide effort to gradually change land use practices towards turning agricultural soils into carbon sinks starting 2014, the projected 87-year (2014e2100) global SOC sequestration potential of agricultural land ranged between 31 and 64 Gt. This is equal to 1.9e3.9% of the SRES-A2 projected 87-year anthropogenic emissions. SOC sequestration would peak 2032e33, at that time reaching 4.3e8.9% of the projected annual SRES-A2 emission. About 30 years later the sequestration rate would have reduced by half. Thus, SOC sequestration is not a C wedge that could contribute increasingly to mitigating CC. Rather, the mitigation potential is limited, contributing very little to solving the climate problem of the coming decades. However, we deliberately did not elaborate on the importance of maintaining or increasing SOC for sustaining soil health, agro-ecosystem functioning and productivity; an issue of global signiﬁcance that deserves proper consideration irrespectively of any potential additional sequestration of SOC.","2014-11","2023-03-14 16:17:34","2023-03-14 16:17:36","2023-03-14 16:17:34","83-87","","","144","","Journal of Environmental Management","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\4EAHCMIU\Sommer and Bossio - 2014 - Dynamics and climate change mitigation potential o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If anthropogenic warming stimulates the loss of this carbon to the atmosphere, it could drive further planetary warming. Despite evidence that warming enhances carbon fluxes to and from the soil, the net global balance between these responses remains uncertain. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of warminginduced changes in soil carbon stocks by assembling data from 49 field experiments located across North America, Europe and Asia. We find that the effects of warming are contingent on the size of the initial soil carbon stock, with considerable losses occurring in high-latitude areas. By extrapolating this empirical relationship to the global scale, we provide estimates of soil carbon sensitivity to warming that may help to constrain Earth system model projections. Our empirical relationship suggests that global soil carbon stocks in the upper soil horizons will fall by 30 +/- 30 petagrams of carbon to 203 +/- 161 petagrams of carbon under one degree of warming, depending on the rate at which the effects of warming are realized. Under the conservative assumption that the response of soil carbon to warming occurs within a year, a business-as-usual climate scenario would drive the loss of 55 +/- 50 petagrams of carbon from the upper soil horizons by 2050. This value is around 12-17 per cent of the expected anthropogenic emissions over this period. Despite the considerable uncertainty in our estimates, the direction of the global soil carbon response is consistent across all scenarios. This provides strong empirical support for the idea that rising temperatures will stimulate the net loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere, driving a positive land carbon-climate feedback that could accelerate climate change.","2016-12-01","2023-03-14 16:21:00","2023-03-15 16:57:04","2023-03-14 16:21:00","104-108","","7631","540","","Nature","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\SVACTR96\Crowther et al. - 2016 - Quantifying global soil carbon losses in response .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So far, the focus has been on developing procedures for legacy point data with special attention to the selection of soil analytical and physical properties considered in the GlobalSoilMap speciﬁcations (e.g. organic carbon, soil pH, soil texture (sand, silt, and clay), coarse fragments ( < 2 mm), cation exchange capacity, electrical conductivity, bulk density, and water holding capacity). Proﬁle data managed in WoSIS were contributed by a wide range of soil data providers; the data have been described, sampled, and analysed according to methods and standards in use in the originating countries. Hence, special attention was paid to measures for soil data quality and the standardisation of soil property deﬁnitions, soil property values, and soil analytical method descriptions. At the time of writing, the full WoSIS database contained some 118 400 unique “shared” soil proﬁles, of which some 96 000 are georeferenced within deﬁned limits. In total, this corresponds with over 31 million soil records, of which some 20 % have so far been quality-assessed and standardised using the sequential procedure discussed in this paper. The number of measured data for each property varies between proﬁles and with depth, generally depending on the purpose of the initial studies. Overall, the data lineage strongly determined which data could be standardised with acceptable conﬁdence in accord with WoSIS procedures, corresponding to over 4 million records for 94 441 proﬁles.

There is also great interest in recognizing the soil system as a significant terrestrial sink of carbon. The reliable assessment of soil carbon (C) stocks is of key importance for soil conservation and in mitigation strategies for increased atmospheric carbon. In this article, we review and discuss the recent advances in digital mapping of soil C. The challenge to map carbon is demonstrated with the large variation of soil C concentration at a field, continental, and global scale. This article reviews recent studies in mapping soil C using digital soil mapping approaches. The general activities in digital soil mapping involve collection of a database of soil carbon observations over the area of interest; compilation of relevant covariates (scorpan factors) for the area; calibration or training of a spatial prediction function based on the observed dataset; interpolation and/or extrapolation of the prediction function over the whole area; and finally validation using existing or independent datasets. We discuss several relevant aspects in digital mapping: carbon concentration and carbon density, source of data, sampling density and resolution, depth of investigation, map validation, map uncertainty, and environmental covariates. We demonstrate harmonization of soil depths using the equal-area spline and the use of a material coordinate system to take into consideration the varying bulk density due to management practices. Soil C mapping has evolved from 2-D mapping of soil C stock at particular depth ranges to a semi3-D soil map allowing the estimation of continuous soil C concentration or density with depth. This review then discusses the dynamics of soil C and the consequences for prediction and mapping of soil C change. Finally, we illustrate the prediction of soil carbon change using a semidynamic scorpan approach.","2013","2023-03-14 18:31:42","2023-03-14 18:31:43","2023-03-14 18:31:42","1-47","","","118","","","","","","","","Elsevier","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-405942-9.00001-3","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\8EMHYUL5\Minasny et al. - 2013 - Digital Mapping of Soil Carbon.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We discuss the various methods that have been, or could be, used for fitting quantitative relationships between soil properties or classes and their ‘environment’. These include generalised linear models, classification and regression trees, neural networks, fuzzy systems and geostatistics. We also review the data layers that have been, or could be, used to describe the ‘environment’. Terrain attributes derived from digital elevation models, and spectral reflectance bands from satellite imagery, have been the most commonly used, but there is a large potential for new data layers. The generic framework, which we call the scorpanSSPFe (soil spatial prediction function with spatially autocorrelated errors) method, is particularly relevant for those places where soil resource information is limited. It is based on the seven predictive scorpan factors, a generalisation of Jenny’s five factors, namely: (1) s: soil, other or previously measured attributes of the soil at a point; (2) c: climate, climatic properties of the environment at a point; (3) o: organisms, including land cover and natural vegetation; (4) r: topography, including terrain attributes and classes; (5) p: parent material, including lithology; (6) a: age, the time factor; (7) n: space, spatial or geographic position. Interactions (*) between these factors are also considered. The scorpan-SSPFe method essentially involves the following steps:  (i) Define soil attribute(s) of interest and decide resolution q and block size b.  (ii) Assemble data layers to represent Q.  (iii) Spatial decomposition or lagging of data layers.  (iv) Sampling of assembled data (Q) to obtain sampling sites.  (v) GPS field sampling and laboratory analysis to obtain soil class or property data.  (vi) Fit quantitative relationships (observing Ockham’s razor) with autocorrelated errors.

The success of digital soil mapping is a conﬂuence of several factors in the beginning of 2000 including the increased availability of spatial data (digital elevation model, satellite imagery), the availability of computing power for processing data, the development of data-mining tools and GIS, and numerous applications beyond geostatistics. In addition, there was an increased global demand for spatial data including uncertainty assessments, and a rejuvenation of many soil survey and university centres which helped in the spreading of digital soil mapping technologies and knowledge. The theoretical framework for digital soil mapping was formalised in a 2003 paper in Geoderma. In this paper, we deﬁne what constitutes digital soil mapping, sketch a brief history of it, and discuss some lessons. Digital soil mapping requires three components: the input in the form of ﬁeld and laboratory observational methods, the process used in terms of spatial and non-spatial soil inference systems, and the output in the form of spatial soil information systems, which includes outputs in the form of rasters of prediction along with the uncertainty of prediction. We also illustrate the history with a number of sleeping beauty papers that seem too precocious and consequently the ideas were not taken up by contemporaries and largely forgotten. It took another 30 to 40 years before the ideas were rediscovered and then ﬂourished. Examples include proximal soil sensing that was developed in the 1920s, soil spectroscopy in 1970s, and soil mapping based on similarity of environmental factors in 1979. In summary, the coming together of emerging topics and timeliness greatly assists in the development of paradigm.

This map allows the estimation of soil organic carbon stock from 0 to 30 cm. It represents a key contribution to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.3.1, which defines the area of degraded land. The novelty of this map is the fact that it is the first ever global soil organic carbon assessment which is produced through a participatory approach. Countries developed their capacities and stepped up e↵orts to compile or collect all available soil information at the national level. The 5th GSP Plenary Assembly, in June 2017, approved the decision of member countries jointly developing a GSOCmap as a baseline for the amount and distribution of organic carbon in soils. This map is part of the process of building a Global Soil Information System (GLOSIS) under the 4th pillar of the GSP, which aims to enhance the quantity and quality of soil data and information. This considerable e↵ort, which led to the launch of the GSOCmap on World Soil Day 2017 (5 December), is paving the way to the establishment of national soil information systems and represents the first step toward introducing a soil monitoring program. This technical report is aimed at scientists. It provides guidance on the process that led to the establishment of the GSOCmap and on how to use it. The map provides users with useful information to monitor the soil condition, identify degraded areas, set restoration targets, explore soil organic carbon sequestration potentials, support the greenhouse gas emission reporting under the UNFCCC. It also provides users with crucial information that is needed to make evidence based decisions to mitigate and adapt to climate change. We can expect that the extensive data content of more than 1 million sampling points resulting from country contributions and the interactive nature of the GSOCmap will greatly assist in the process of building a global soil information system, which in turn will help contribute in the achievement of the sustainable development goals. We are proud to make this very first edition of the Global Soil Organic Carbon Map technical summary available for the international scientific community, and we hope that this map will be a major step in combating not only climate change which is directly linked to soil organic carbon, but also poverty, hunger and malnutrition. The contributing institutions from the participating countries which submitted their maps or data are listed in Appendix A. This technical report is a companion report to the GSOCmap V1.5.0.

Equal weights averaging (EW), Bates–Granger or variance weighted averaging (VW), Granger–Ramanathan averaging (GRA), and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) were compared in this study. Model averaged predictions were estimated to 2 m depth at regular depth intervals. 90% prediction intervals of the model averaged predictions were derived numerically. Neither the disaggregated soil map nor the scorpan kriging map was particularly accurate. Predictions from model averaging however did improve upon the accuracy, where at all depths, the combined predictions were an improvement on using either of the contributing soil maps alone. We recommend the use of GRA for digital soil mapping applications because its performance is equal to or better than the generally preferred BMA approach, yet far simpler to implement, and is computationally efﬁcient.

We examined temperature and moisture responses of C and N mineralization in an 85-d laboratory incubation (factorial combination of four temperatures [5, 12, 18, 25°C] and five moisture treatments [matric potential from −5 to −1200 kPa]) using three agriculturally important New Zealand soils (soils with a history of pasture, arable, or vegetable cropping). Mineralization was linearly related to gravimetric moisture content, except in the high-C pasture soil where O2 supply apparently limited mineralization at high (25°C) temperature–moisture combinations. Temperature responses were adequately described by a Q10 function (Q10 values for C mineralization ranged 1.9–2.8). The pool of mineralizable C, estimated using a first-order kinetic model, increased as temperature and moisture increased, whereas the rate constant did not show a consistent trend with either temperature or moisture. Part of the C mineralized during the incubation was from the microbial biomass (post-incubation biomass C decreased by an average of 0.22–0.31 mg kg−1 for each 1 mg kg−1 CO2–C evolved). Microbial biomass C (MBC) was particularly sensitive to temperature (post-incubation biomass C decreased 18–35% between 5–25°C). The decline in MBC between 5 and 12°C represented an average of 40% of the C mineralization increase in that temperature interval. Between 18 and 25°C, the decline in MBC was equivalent to only 20% (on average) of the C mineralized in that temperature interval. High Q10 values reported in laboratory incubations at low temperature may be partly due to mineralization of microbial C.","2012-11","2023-03-14 21:17:46","2023-03-14 21:18:45","2023-03-14 21:17:46","2055-2067","","6","76","","Soil Science Society of America Journal","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\7M53A3UY\Curtin et al. - 2012 - Temperature and Moisture Effects on Microbial Biom.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If carbon stored belowground is transferred to the atmosphere by a warming-induced acceleration of its decomposition, a positive feedback to climate change would occur. Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition.

However, rates of C accumulation and underlying mechanisms have rarely been determined for a range of managed and successional ecosystems on the same soil type. We determined soil organic matter (SOM) fractions with the highest potential for sequestering C in ten ecosystems on the same soil series using both density- and incubation-based fractionation methods. Ecosystems included four annual row-crop systems (conventional, low input, organic and no-till), two perennial cropping systems (alfalfa and poplar), and four native ecosystems (early successional, midsuccessional historically tilled, midsuccessional never-tilled, and late successional forest). Enhanced C storage to 5 cm relative to conventional agriculture ranged from 8.9 g C (m2 /y) in low input row crops to 31.6 g C (m2/ y) in the early successional ecosystem. Carbon sequestration across all ecosystems occurred in aggregate-associated pools larger than 53 um. The density-based fractionation scheme identified heavy-fraction C pools (SOM > 1.6 g cm3) plus SOM < 53 um), particularly those in macroaggregates (>250 um), as having the highest potential C accumulation rates, ranging from 8.79 g C (m2/y)  in low input row crops to 29.22 g C (m2/y)  in the alfalfa ecosystem. Intra-aggregate light fraction pools accumulated C at slower rates, but generally faster than in interaggregate LF pools. Incubation-based methods that fractionated soil into active, slow and passive pools showed that C accumulated primarily in slow and resistant pools. However, crushing aggregates in a manner that simulates tillage resulted in a substantial transfer of C from slow pools with field mean residence times of decades to active pools with mean residence times of only weeks. Our results demonstrate that soil C accumulates almost entirely in soil aggregates, mostly in macroaggregates, following reductions in land use intensity. The potentially rapid destruction of macroaggregates following tillage, however, raises concerns about the long-term persistence of these C pools.","2007-02","2023-03-14 21:22:27","2023-03-15 17:17:14","2023-03-14 21:22:27","59-74","","1","10","","Ecosystems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\V7TJD58U\Grandy and Robertson - 2007 - Land-Use Intensity Effects on Soil Organic Carbon .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the effects of cultivation on soil carbon are well studied, studies of soil-carbon recovery after cultivation are limited4±11. Here we present a fourdecade-long Æeld study of carbon accumulation by pine ecosystems established on previously cultivated soils in South Carolina, USA7.

By the 1990s, however, carbon accumulated only in forest biomass, forest Øoor, and the upper 7.5 cm of the mineral soil. Although the forest was a strong carbon sink, trees accounted for about 80%, the forest Øoor 20%, and mineral soil ,1%, of the carbon accretion. Despite high carbon inputs to the mineral soil, carbon sequestration was limited by rapid decomposition, facilitated by the coarse soil texture and low-activity clay mineralogy.","1999-07","2023-03-14 21:24:10","2023-03-15 17:28:24","2023-03-14 21:24:10","56-58","","6739","400","","Nature","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\NZKQAVIA\Richter et al. - 1999 - Rapid accumulation and turnover of soil carbon in .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Soils are the major storage of carbon in the terrestrial biosphere and the inventory of soil organic carbon (SOC) is required for greenhouse gas inventories and carbon mitigation projects. The aim of this study is to characterize spatial patterns of the concentrations of topsoil total organic carbon (TOC) in a semi-arid Mediterranean area in south-eastern Spain and to assess their relationship to topography. We adopt a remote sensing based approach for the spectral determination and quantiﬁcation of TOC with a complete coverage of bare soil surfaces. Digital terrain analysis and geostatistical techniques are applied to analyze the spatial patterns of TOC at different spatial scales. We show that accumulation of topsoil SOC is dependent on topographic position at the landscape scale with highest values found in valley bottoms. At the hill-slope scale, differences among terrain classes exist regarding the topographic controls on SOC. While positive correlation between the topographic wetness index (TWI) and TOC can be observed on steep slopes, that correlation is not signiﬁcant on wide pediments. Small scale spatial variability is large on ridges, steep slopes and valley bottoms, while SOC distribution on pediments is relatively homogeneous. These differences are most likely governed by the presence of vegetation patches and variable runoff and sediment transport rates among the terrain classes. The successful application of hyperspectral remote sensing for the spatial estimation of SOC concentrations suggests that it is a promising technique to advance SOC inventories in semi-arid and arid regions.","2011-03","2023-03-14 21:26:30","2023-03-14 21:26:31","2023-03-14 21:26:30","252-263","","1-2","126","","Geomorphology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\ULGLAFVT\Schwanghart and Jarmer - 2011 - Linking spatial patterns of soil organic carbon to.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is fundamental to soil and ecosystem functions across a wide range of scales, from site-specific soil fertility and water holding capacity to global biogeochemical cycling. It is also a highly complex material that is sensitive to direct and indirect human impacts. In SOM research, simulation models play an important role by providing a mathematical framework to integrate, examine, and test the understanding of SOM dynamics. Simulation models of SOM are also increasingly used in more ‘applied’ settings to evaluate human impacts on ecosystem function, and to manage SOM for greenhouse gas mitigation, improved soil health, and sustainable use as a natural resource. Within this context, there is a need to maintain a robust connection between scientific developments in SOM modeling approaches and SOM model applications. This need forms the basis of this review. In this review we first provide an overview of SOM modeling, focusing on SOM theory, data-model integration, and model development as evidenced by a quantitative review of SOM literature. Second, we present the landscape of SOM model applications, focusing on examples in climate change policy. We conclude by discussing five areas of recent developments in SOM modeling including: (1) microbial roles in SOM stabilization; (2) modeling SOM saturation kinetics; (3) temperature controls on decomposition; (4) SOM dynamics in deep soil layers; and (5) SOM representation in earth system models. Our aim is to comprehensively connect SOM model development to its applications, revealing knowledge gaps in need of focused interdisciplinary attention and exposing pitfalls that, if avoided, can lead to best use of SOM models to support policy initiatives and sustainable land management solutions.","2015-12-01","2023-03-14 21:33:54","2023-03-15 16:54:45","2023-03-14 21:33:54","123004","","12","10","","Environ.

The Unified North American Soil Map (UNASM) was developed to provide more accurate regional soil information for terrestrial biosphere modeling. The UNASM combines information from state-of-the-art US STATSGO2 and Soil Landscape of Canada (SLCs) databases. The area not covered by these datasets is filled by using the Harmonized World Soil Database version 1.21 (HWSD1.21). The UNASM contains maximum soil depth derived from the data source as well as seven soil attributes (including sand, silt, and clay content, gravel content, organic carbon content, pH, and bulk density) for the topsoil layer (0–30 cm) and the subsoil layer (30–100 cm), respectively, of the spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees in latitude and longitude. There are pronounced differences in the spatial distributions of soil properties and soil organic carbon between UNASM and HWSD, but the UNASM overall provides more detailed and higher-quality information particularly in Alaska and central Canada. To provide more accurate and up-to-date estimate of soil organic carbon stock in North America, we incorporated Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) into the UNASM. The estimate of total soil organic carbon mass in the upper 100 cm soil profile based on the improved UNASM is 365.96 Pg, of which 23.1% is under trees, 14.1% is in shrubland, and 4.6% is in grassland and cropland. This UNASM data will provide a resource for use in terrestrial ecosystem modeling both for input of soil characteristics and for benchmarking model output.","2013-05-02","2023-03-14 21:36:36","2023-03-14 21:36:40","2023-03-14 21:36:36","2915-2930","","5","10","","Biogeosciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\R9XYG25B\Liu et al. - 2013 - The Unified North American Soil Map and its implic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We test an index of soil organic matter based on the soil organic carbon (SOC) to clay ratio, defined by thresholds of SOC/clay ratio for specified levels of soil structural quality. The thresholds were originally delineated for a small number of Swiss soils. We assess the index using data from the initial sampling (1978–83) of the National Soil Inventory of England and Wales, covering 3,809 sites under arable land, grassland and woodland. Land use, soil type, annual precipitation and soil pH together explained 21% of the variance in SOC/clay ratio in the dataset, with land use the most important variable. Thresholds of SOC/clay ratio of 1/8, 1/10 and 1/13 indicated the boundaries between “very good”, “good”, “moderate” and “degraded” levels of structural condition. On this scale, 38.2, 6.6 and 5.6% of arable, grassland and woodland sites, respectively, were degraded. The index gives a method to assess and monitor soil organic matter at national, regional or sub-regional scales based on two routinely measured soil properties.

SOC storage is highly sensitive to several dynamic environmental drivers, with approximately one third of soils degraded and losing carbon worldwide. Digital soil mapping illuminates where hotspots of SOC storage occur and where losses to the atmosphere are most likely. Yet, attempts to map SOC often disagree. Here we compare national scale SOC concentration map products to reveal agreement of data in mineral soils, with progressively poorer agreement in organo-mineral and organic soils. Divergences in map predictions from each other and survey data widen in the high SOC content land types we stratified. Given the disparities are highest in carbon rich soils, efforts are required to reduce these uncertainties to increase confidence in mapping SOC storage and predicting where change may be important at national to global scales. Our map comparison results could be used to identify SOC risk where concentrations are high and should be conserved, and where uncertainty is high and further monitoring should be targeted. Reducing inter-map uncertainty will rely on addressing statistical limitations and including covariates that capture convergence of physical factors that produce high SOC contents.","2022-01-26","2023-03-15 17:37:17","2023-03-15 17:37:20","2023-03-15 17:37:17","1379","","1","12","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\UE5HXAHS\Feeney et al. - 2022 - Multiple soil map comparison highlights challenges.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Carbon allocation, stocks, and residence times together define the dynamic state of the terrestrial carbon cycle. These quantities are difficult to measure and remain poorly quantified on a global scale. Here, we retrieve global 1° × 1° carbon state and process variables by combining a carbon balance model with satellite observations of biomass and leaf area (where and when available) and global soil carbon data. Our results reveal emergent continental-scale patterns and relationships between carbon states and processes. We find that conventional land cover types cannot capture continental-scale variations of retrieved carbon variables; this mismatch has strong implications for terrestrial carbon cycle predictions.           ,                             The terrestrial carbon cycle is currently the least constrained component of the global carbon budget. Large uncertainties stem from a poor understanding of plant carbon allocation, stocks, residence times, and carbon use efficiency. Imposing observational constraints on the terrestrial carbon cycle and its processes is, therefore, necessary to better understand its current state and predict its future state. We combine a diagnostic ecosystem carbon model with satellite observations of leaf area and biomass (where and when available) and soil carbon data to retrieve the first global estimates, to our knowledge, of carbon cycle state and process variables at a 1° × 1° resolution; retrieved variables are independent from the plant functional type and steady-state paradigms. Our results reveal global emergent relationships in the spatial distribution of key carbon cycle states and processes. Live biomass and dead organic carbon residence times exhibit contrasting spatial features (r2 = 0.3). Allocation to structural carbon is highest in the wet tropics (85–88%) in contrast to higher latitudes (73–82%), where allocation shifts toward photosynthetic carbon. Carbon use efficiency is lowest (0.42–0.44) in the wet tropics. We find an emergent global correlation between retrievals of leaf mass per leaf area and leaf lifespan (r2 = 0.64–0.80) that matches independent trait studies. We show that conventional land cover types cannot adequately describe the spatial variability of key carbon states and processes (multiple correlation median = 0.41). This mismatch has strong implications for the prediction of terrestrial carbon dynamics, which are currently based on globally applied parameters linked to land cover or plant functional types.","2016-02-02","2023-03-16 18:23:09","2023-03-16 18:24:08","2023-03-16 18:23:09","1285-1290","","5","113","","Proc.

However, they are a nonrenewable natural resource and especially reactive to human disturbance and climate change. Despite its importance, soil carbon dynamics is an important source of uncertainty for future climate predictions and there is a growing need for more precise information to better understand the mechanisms controlling soil carbon dynamics and better constrain Earth system models. The aim of our work is to compare soil organic carbon stocks given by different global and regional databases that already exist. We calculated global and regional soil carbon stocks at 1 m depth given by three existing databases (SoilGrids, the Harmonized World Soil Database, and the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database). We observed that total stocks predicted by each product differ greatly: it is estimated to be around 3,400 Pg by SoilGrids and is about 2,500 Pg according to Harmonized World Soil Database. This difference is marked in particular for boreal regions where differences can be related to high disparities in soil organic carbon concentration. Differences in other regions are more limited and may be related to differences in bulk density estimates. Finally, evaluation of the three data sets versus ground truth data shows that (i) there is a signiﬁcant difference in spatial patterns between ground truth data and compared data sets and that (ii) data sets underestimate by more than 40% the soil organic carbon stock compared to ﬁeld data.","2018-01","2023-03-17 16:23:17","2023-03-17 16:23:19","2023-03-17 16:23:17","42-56","","1","32","","Global Biogeochem.

Land managers typically rely on computationally complex models ﬁt using sparse datasets to make these accounts and predictions. The model complexity and sparsity of the data can lead to over-ﬁtting, leading to inaccurate results when making predictions with new data. Modellers address over-ﬁtting by simplifying their models and reducing the number of parameters, and in the current context this could involve neglecting some soil organic carbon (SOC) components. In this study, we introduce two novel SOC models and a new RothC-like model and investigate how the SOC components and complexity of the SOC models aﬀect the SOC prediction in the presence of small and sparse time series data. We develop model selection methods that can identify the soil carbon model with the best predictive performance, in light of the available data. Through this analysis we reveal that commonly used complex soil carbon models can over-ﬁt in the presence of sparse time series data, and our simpler models can produce more accurate predictions.","2022-03-07","2023-03-17 18:15:39","2023-03-17 18:15:41","2023-03-17 18:15:39","","","","","","","Modelling and predicting soil carbon sequestration","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2105.04789 [stat]","","D:\Adatafolder\Zotero\storage\MW8FKBCQ\Davoudabadi et al. - 2022 - Modelling and predicting soil carbon sequestration.pdf","","","Statistics - Applications; Statistics - Computation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2105.04789","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This portal provides researchers and community stakeholders access to climatological data and resources, currently focusing on the state of Hawai'i. The portal provides interactive access to and visualization of hosted historical and near-real-time gridded maps and aggregated sensor station observational data. Climate data (currently precipitation and temperature) from sensor stations are collected, quality controlled, and processed daily to produce high-resolution gridded maps of climate data. A publicly available web application allows users to navigate the available data and visualize the produced gridded data products and sensor stations data on an interactive map element, view information about the sensor stations used to produce a given map, and generate time series from sensor station data. The portal can also generate packages of data to export from the application. The portal is designed to host and disseminate any climatological variables that can be processed into a set of observational data and gridded value maps. The established workflow and automation procedure is generally extensible to additional variables and will be used similarly to expand the scope of the portal.","2021-11-22","2023-03-31 19:10:40","2023-03-31 19:17:37","","e6727","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cpe.6727","","","","climate; hydrology; precipitation; science gateways; sustainability; Tapis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify the ﬁve major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) and terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ . For the last decade available (2009–2018), EFF was 9.5±0.5 GtC yr−1, ELUC 1.5±0.7 GtC yr−1, GATM 4.9±0.02 GtC yr−1 (2.3±0.01 ppm yr−1), SOCEAN 2.5±0.6 GtC yr−1, and SLAND 3.2±0.6 GtC yr−1, with a budget imbalance BIM of 0.4 GtC yr−1 indicating overestimated emissions and/or underestimated sinks. For the year 2018 alone, the growth in EFF was about 2.1 % and fossil emissions increased to 10.0 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, reaching 10 GtC yr−1 for the ﬁrst time in history, ELUC was 1.5 ± 0.7 GtC yr−1, for total anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 11.5 ± 0.9 GtC yr−1 (42.5 ± 3.3 GtCO2). Also for 2018, GATM was 5.1 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 (2.4 ± 0.1 ppm yr−1), SOCEAN was 2.6 ± 0.6 GtC yr−1, and SLAND was 3.5±0.7 GtC yr−1, with a BIM of 0.3 GtC. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 407.38±0.1 ppm averaged over 2018. For 2019, preliminary data for the ﬁrst 6–10 months indicate a reduced growth in EFF of +0.6 % (range of −0.2 % to 1.5 %) based on national emissions projections for China, the USA, the EU, and India and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. Overall, the mean and trend in the ﬁve components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2018, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr−1 persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO2 ﬂuxes. A detailed comparison among individual estimates and the introduction of a broad range of observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 ﬂux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent underestimation of the CO2 variability by ocean models outside the tropics. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Quéré et al., 2018a, b, 2016, 2015a, b, 2014, 2013).
